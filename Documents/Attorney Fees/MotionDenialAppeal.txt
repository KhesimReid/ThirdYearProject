This is an appeal from the district court's denial of a motion to enforce an attorney's lien in an underlying mortgage dispute. Attorney Valeriano Diviacchi was one of several lawyers representing defendant Camilla Warrender in an action brought against her by her mortgagee, Sovereign Bank.1 Shortly after Diviacchi entered his appearance, Warrender, without Diviacchi's assistance, was able to find a third-party purchaser for her property and negotiate with Sovereign Bank for the dismissal of its claims against her. Prior to the completion of the settlement, Diviacchi filed a notice of attorney's lien pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 221, section 50 (“section 50”). The sale of the property went smoothly and Sovereign Bank dismissed its claims against Warrender. Diviacchi nonetheless moved for enforcement of his lien against funds derived from the sale of the property. The district court denied his motion. We affirm that decision.
I.
In June 2011, Sovereign Bank commenced this action in the District of Massachusetts against Warrender to collect on a $2.5 million loan that was secured by property on Nantucket.2 On May 1, 2012, Warrender hired Diviacchi to represent her. The fee arrangement provided for Diviacchi to receive either a contingent fee (calculated as a percentage of the gross amount collected from her counterclaim, if any) or a flat, nonrefundable fee of $25,000 ($15,000 of which was paid upfront). One week after he was retained, Diviacchi entered his appearance and filed an amended counterclaim against Sovereign Bank. Sovereign Bank filed a motion to dismiss the counterclaim on May 17.
Shortly after entering his appearance, Diviacchi briefly left the state to attend his daughter's college graduation. He requested, and was partially granted, a stay of proceedings for thirty days. That stay applied to any scheduling and response deadlines, but the court held that the non-judicial foreclosure of Warrender's property, scheduled for May 24, could proceed regardless of Diviacchi's availability.3 As a result, Warrender hired attorneys from the law firm of Jacobi & Chamberlain LLP, who entered a limited appearance for the purpose of “filing Defendant's Emergency Motion For A Temporary Restraining Order And Motion For Preliminary Injunction in the above-captioned action while defendant and plaintiff-in-counter-claim awaits the return of her new counsel from vacation.” After oral argument on May 22, the court denied the motion, thereby declining to enjoin the foreclosure sale of Warrender's property. Jacobi & Chamberlain LLP represented Warrender in an interlocutory appeal of that decision. We ordered the parties to participate in mediation.4
On June 6, Warrender notified Diviacchi by email that she had received an offer for the property from a third party and Sovereign Bank was offering to settle the case pursuant to the short sale5 and forgive the loan. Diviacchi responded, telling Warrender that if she were to settle, she would still owe him the $10,000 balance on the flat fee. Meanwhile, on June 14, Diviacchi filed an opposition to Sovereign Bank's motion to dismiss the counterclaim.
In July, due to Warrender's alleged refusal to pay the remaining portion of the flat fee in accordance with the fee agreement, Diviacchi filed a notice of attorney's lien in the action in accordance with section 50. Three days after the lien was filed, as a result of the court-ordered mediation, Warrender and Sovereign Bank agreed to a settlement pursuant to a stipulation (allegedly unbeknownst to Diviacchi) that Warrender's property be sold for $2.24 million to a third party. Sovereign Bank agreed to forgive the loan and waive its right to a deficiency judgment in exchange for $1.9 million of the proceeds from the short sale. The remaining proceeds were left to Warrender ($340,000 in total). Of the $340,000, after other debts were paid in order to transfer clear title (including the debts accrued by the hiring of Jacobi & Chamberlain LLP), Warrender had over $175,000 remaining. Only the attorneys of Jacobi & Chamberlain LLP signed the stipulation on behalf of Warrender. On September 6, 2012, one day after the sale of the property, a stipulation of dismissal was submitted to the court (also allegedly unbeknownst to Diviacchi).6
Diviacchi then filed a Motion to Enforce Attorney's Lien Against All Parties, seeking almost $100,000 in accordance with the contingency fee provision (i.e., one-third of the $340,000 minus the $15,000 paid on the flat fee). In April 2013, the district court denied the motion to enforce the lien, holding that it failed to comply with section 50. In May 2013, the court denied Diviacchi's motion for reconsideration. This appeal from Diviacchi followed. We review de novo the district court's determination that the attorney's lien was not enforceable under section 50. See Gargano v. Liberty Int'l Underwriters, 572 F.3d 45, 49 (1st Cir.2009) (“[W]e review de novo the district court's interpretation of state law.”).
II.
Section 50 provides, in pertinent part:
From the authorized commencement of an action, counterclaim or other proceeding in any court, or appearance in any proceeding before any state or federal department, board or commission, the attorney who appears for a client in such proceeding shall have a lien for his reasonable fees and expenses upon his client's cause of action, counterclaim or claim, upon the judgment, decree or other order in his client's favor entered or made in such proceeding, and upon the proceeds derived therefrom.
The district court concluded that Diviacchi was not entitled to enforcement of his lien pursuant to that statute. Initially, the court concluded that there was no judgment in favor of Warrender. In the alternative, the court held that Diviacchi “failed to make a showing that he incurred reasonable fees and expenses here.” After reconsideration, the court added, without reversing its prior decision, that even if the stipulation of dismissal constituted a judgment, it did not result in “proceeds” being paid on Warrender's counterclaim.
Thus, the district court's holding had three components. First, the court concluded that the settlement reached in this case did not constitute a “judgment, decree or other order in [Warrender's] favor” within the meaning of section 50. Second, the court concluded that Warrender received no “proceeds” upon which a lien could attach. Id. Third, the court concluded that the fees requested were not shown to be reasonable. We address each of these conclusions in turn.
Massachusetts courts have consistently held that “for purposes of [Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 221, § 50], a ‘judgment’ includes a stipulation of dismissal.” Ne. Avionics, Inc. v. City of Westfield, 63 Mass.App.Ct. 509, 827 N.E.2d 721, 725 (Mass.App.Ct.2005); see also Craft v. Kane, 51 Mass.App.Ct. 648, 747 N.E.2d 748, 752 (Mass.App.Ct.2001) (“[T]he stipulation of dismissal constituted a judgment within the meaning of the attorney's lien statute.”). Here, it is undisputed that the parties agreed to a settlement whereby Sovereign Bank would forgive Warrender's debt and waive its right to a deficiency judgment against her in exchange for a cash payment derived from the short sale of the property. Because the result of that settlement was the dismissal of claims against Warrender, the stipulation of dismissal could fairly be interpreted as a judgment in her favor. See, e.g., Ne. Avionics, 827 N.E.2d at 725–26. Accordingly, Diviacchi is correct in his assertion that the stipulation of dismissal here could have provided the basis for an attorney's lien.
The problem, however, is that an attorney's lien must attach to something. In other words, there must be “ ‘proceeds derived’ from a ‘cause of action’ as a result of a settlement.” Ropes & Gray LLP v. Jalbert, 454 Mass. 418, 910 N.E.2d 339 n. 12 (Mass.2009); see also Curly Customs, Inc. v. Pioneer Fin., 62 Mass.App.Ct. 92, 814 N.E.2d 1176, 1179 (Mass.App.Ct.2004) ( “[I]f there are no such proceeds, there is no lien.” (citing Torphy v. Reder, 357 Mass. 153, 257 N.E.2d 435, 437–38 (Mass.1970)). He
