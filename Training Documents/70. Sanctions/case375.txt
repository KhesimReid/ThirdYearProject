 Melvin Reed, the plaintiff in this Title VII religious-discrimination suit, appeals from the grant of summary judgment to his former employer, Great Lakes, and from the imposition of sanctions on him.   His lawyer wants the $500 sanction imposed on her also reversed, but she failed to file a notice of appeal and the notice of appeal that she filed on behalf of Reed does not mention her sanction.   Although Fed. R.App. P. 3(c)(4) provides that an appeal should not be dismissed “for failure to name a party whose intent to appeal is otherwise clear from the notice [of appeal],” the lawyer's intent to appeal is not clear from the notice of appeal-indeed is not so much as hinted at in it-and as a result we lack jurisdiction over her challenge to the sanction that was imposed on her.  Bogle v.

Construed as favorably to Reed as the record permits, the facts of the case are as follows.   He was hired to be the executive housekeeper of a newly opened Holiday Inn that Great Lakes operates in Milwaukee.   One of his duties was to see to it that a copy of the Bible, supplied free of charge to the hotel by the Gideons, was placed in every room.   It is customary for representatives of management to meet with the Gideons when they deliver Bibles to a newly opened hotel.   Reed had been working for Great Lakes for less than a month when the Gideons showed up to deliver the Bibles.   A few days before their scheduled arrival, the manager of the Holiday Inn had told Reed in a joking manner that they were going to “pray with the Gideons,” which Reed understood to mean that, given his responsibility for the distribution of the Bibles to the rooms, he was to accompany the manager to the meeting at which they would receive the Bibles from the Gideons.   Reed did not object to attending the meeting.   But, to the manager's surprise, at the meeting the Gideons, besides delivering Bibles, did some Bible reading and some praying.   Reed was offended by the religious character of the meeting and left in the middle, to the manager's chagrin.   Later in the day, the manager ran into Reed and told him:  “Don't do that again, you embarrassed me.”   Reed riposted:  “You can't compel me to a religious event,” to which the manager replied that Reed would do what he was told to do.   Reed responded, “Oh, hell no, you won't, not when it comes to my spirituality,” whereupon the manager fired him for insubordination.
Oddly, Reed at his deposition refused to indicate what if any religious affiliation or beliefs (or nonbeliefs) he has;  refused even to deny that he might be a Gideon!   His position was that Title VII forbids an employer to require an employee to attend a religious meeting, period.
Title VII does forbid an employer, unless it is a religious organization, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-1;  Corporation of Presiding Bishop v. Amos, 483 U.S. 327, 329-30, 107 S.Ct. 2862, 97 L.Ed.2d 273 (1987), which Great Lakes is not, to discriminate against an employee on the basis of the employee's religion.  42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1).   And for these purposes, as assumed by the parties, as strongly intimated in EEOC v. Townley Engineering & Mfg. Co., 859 F.2d 610, 613-14 n. 5 (9th Cir.1988), and Young v. Southwestern Savings & Loan Ass'n, 509 F.2d 140, 142 (5th Cir.1975), and as supported by analogy to cases under the free-exercise clause of the First Amendment, County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, 492 U.S. 573, 589-90, 109 S.Ct. 3086, 106 L.Ed.2d 472 (1989);  Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U.S. 38, 52-53, 105 S.Ct. 2479, 86 L.Ed.2d 29 (1985);  Books v. City of Elkhart, 235 F.3d 292, 307 (7th Cir.2000) Warner v. Orange County Dep't of Probation, 173 F.3d 120, 120-22 (2d Cir.1999)-cases which hold that religious freedom includes the freedom to reject religion-“religion” includes antipathy to religion.   And so an atheist (which Reed may or may not be) cannot be fired because his employer dislikes atheists.   If we think of religion as taking a position on divinity, then atheism is indeed a form of religion.
 But there is no indication that Reed was fired because of his religious beliefs, identity, or observances or because of his aversion to religion, to Christianity, or to the Gideons, whatever the case may be (remember that we don't know anything about his religion or lack of religion).   Great Lakes accepts Bibles from the Gideons because the Bibles are free, not because any of Great Lakes' owners or managers, including the manager of the Holiday Inn who fired Reed, is a Gideon.   So far as appears, none is.   The manager's joking reference to “pray[ing] with the Gideons” makes it pretty clear that he is not one of them;  anyway there is no contention that he is.   For that matter, there is no evidence that he expected to encounter prayers and Bible reading at the meeting with them.   At previous such meetings the Gideons had handed over the Bibles and the manager had thanked them, and that was that.   The religious service was a surprise.   It is apparent that the manager fired Reed because Reed's sudden departure from the meeting was embarrassing to the manager, who would be in trouble with his superiors if the Gideons became huffy and cut off the supply of free Bibles to Great Lakes hotels, and also because Reed's refusal to see the manager's point of view indicated that he was unlikely to be a cooperative employee.
The manager must have been indifferent to Reed's religious views, because Reed never expressed them to the manager;  to this day we do not know what his religion is, as he refused to say at his deposition.   It is difficult to see how an employer can be charged with discrimination on the basis of an employee's religion when he doesn't know the employee's religion (or lack thereof, which, as we have noted, is in the eyes of the law a form of religion), O'Connor v. Northshore Int'l Ins. Services, 61 Fed.Appx. 722 (1st Cir.2003) (per curiam);  Lubetsky v. Applied Card Systems, Inc., 296 F.3d 1301, 1305-06 (11th Cir.2002), though the employee can survive summary judgment if, while declining to specify his religious beliefs, he attests that they differ from his employer's and that that is why he was fired.  Venters v. City of Delphi, 123 F.3d 956, 972 (7th Cir.1997);  Shapolia v. Los Alamos Nat'l Laboratory, 992 F.2d 1033, 1037 (10th Cir.1993).
 Reed has utterly failed to make a prima facie case of intentional religious discrimination.   But he has another string to his bow.   Besides forbidding intentional discrimination, Title VII requires an employer to try to accommodate the religious needs of its employees, that is, to try to adjust the requirements of the job so that the employee can remain employed without giving up the practice of his religion, provided the adjustment would not work an undue hardship on the employer.  42 U.S.C. § 2000e(j);  Ansonia Board of Education v. Philbrook, 479 U.S. 60, 70, 107 S.Ct. 367, 93 L.Ed.2d 305 (1986);  Anderson v. U.S.F. Logistics (IMC), Inc., 274 F.3d 470, 475 (7th Cir.2001);  Cosme v. Henderson, 287 F.3d 152, 158 (2d Cir.2002);  Shelton v. University of Medicine & Dentistry, 223 F.3d 220, 224 (3d Cir.2000).   And again for these purposes hostility to religion counts as a form of religion.   So if attending a meeting at which Gideons might pray or read from the Bible would offend Reed's religious or antireligious sensibilities, he might be entitled to an accommodation.
 We say “might be” rather than “would be” for two reasons.   First, the duty to accommodate is not absolute;  the cost to the employer must be considered.  Ansonia Board of Education v. Philbrook, supra, 479 U.S. at 70, 107 S.Ct. 367;  Rodriguez v. City of Chicago
