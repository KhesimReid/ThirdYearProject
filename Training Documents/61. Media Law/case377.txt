Tribune Publishing Company petitions for review of the National Labor Relations Board's decision determining that the Company violated the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. §§ 151-169 (2008), by unilaterally discontinuing the use of the Company's direct deposit system to collect union dues.   Because the National Labor Relations Board's decision is supported by substantial evidence and is consistent with the law, we deny the petition and grant the National Labor Relations Board's cross-application to enforce its order.
Background
No factual issues appear to be in dispute.   Petitioner Tribune Publishing Company (“Tribune” or “Company”) publishes a daily newspaper in Columbia, Missouri.   Certain press room employees, including operators of the printing presses, are represented by the Graphic Communications International Union (“Union”).   In 1997 the Company and the Union entered into a collective bargaining agreement (“CBA”), which included a provision for payroll deduction of union dues upon written request of the employee.  (Commonly referred to as “dues checkoff.”)   Approximately 37 employees used this procedure to have their union dues deducted from their paychecks.   The CBA expired on November 30, 2001.   The Company nevertheless continued dues checkoff until December 19, 2001, at which time it sent each employee a letter stating that the Company was exercising its legal right to discontinue payroll deduction of union dues because the CBA had expired.   Thereafter, the Union's secretary-treasurer apparently began collecting union dues from each individual employee.
During this time period, Company policy provided for the direct deposit of an employee's paycheck into a bank account;  direct deposit also allowed the employee to pay loans and deposit to other accounts such as savings.   With this direct deposit provision in mind, after expiration of the contract and while the parties were bargaining for a new contract, the Union secretary-treasurer obtained a direct deposit authorization form, reproduced it 37 times, filled in some of the information on the forms and had each employee complete his or her form.   He then took the forms to Tribune's administrative manager, Mary Twenter, who had previously been on the negotiating committee for the expired contract and had oversight responsibility for the Company's labor relations and human resources.   Twenter told the Union secretary-treasurer that it was “a good idea” to use direct deposit for the payment of union dues and, accepted the direct deposit forms for processing.   After a trial run in April, 2002, the Company effectuated the direct deposit of union dues on May 10, 2002, and provided to the Union an itemized list containing the names of the depositing employees and the amount of their dues payments.   On May 24, 2002, however, after only a one-time use of direct deposit for payment of union dues, administrative manager Twenter sent a letter to each employee stating that direct deposit of union dues was being discontinued because dues checkoff had “been previously discontinued by the Company and the direct deposit transactions reinstated dues checkoff. Establishing direct deposit for dues was a mistake.”
On May 30, 2002, the Union filed with the National Labor Relations Board (“NLRB” or “Board”) an unfair labor practice charge against the Company.   The NLRB investigated the charge and issued a complaint against the Company alleging, inter alia, that the Company violated Sections 8(a)(5) and (1) of the National Labor Relations Act (the “Act”) by unilaterally discontinuing the direct deposit of union dues.   A hearing was held before an NLRB administrative law judge (“ALJ”), who determined that direct deposit of payroll deductions constitute working conditions of the Union employees and are therefore mandatory subjects of collective bargaining under the Act. He also determined that the direct deposit of union dues was a separate procedure unrelated to the CBA. The ALJ consequently found that the Company violated Sections 8(a)(5) and (1) of the Act * when it changed the working conditions of its employees by ceasing to allow direct deposit of union dues without affording the Union an opportunity to bargain about that conduct.
The Company filed exceptions to the ALJ's decision, and the matter was assigned to a three-member panel of the NLRB. In adopting the ALJ's conclusion that the Company violated Sections 8(a)(5) and (1) of the Act, the NLRB panel noted that, after expiration of the contract and unilateral cessation of the direct deposit of union dues by the Company, the Union secretary-treasurer met with Company administrative manager Twenter, and that during the meeting Twenter agreed with the Union secretary-treasurer to allow use of the direct deposit system for the payment of union dues.   The panel also noted that the Company had implemented direct deposit of union dues for a full pay period.   In light of these circumstances, the panel determined that the deduction and direct deposit of union dues became a new term and condition of employment.   Since direct deposit of payroll deductions is a mandatory subject of bargaining, the panel stated, the Company was required to bargain with the Union before it could terminate the deductions.   Because it failed to bargain, the panel concluded that the Company violated Sections 8(a)(5) and (1) of the Act.
The Company now files with this court a petition for review, seeking reversal of the panel's conclusion and dismissal of the charges against it.
Discussion
 “We enforce a Board order if the factual findings upon which it rests are supported by ‘substantial evidence,’ see United States Testing Co. v. NLRB, 160 F.3d 14, 19 (D.C.Cir.1998), and the Board's interpretation of the Act is reasonable and consistent with applicable precedent, see Local 702, Int'l Bhd. of Elec. Workers, AFL-CIO v. NLRB, 215 F.3d 11, 15 (D.C.Cir.2000).”   Fashion Valley Mall, LLC. v. NLRB, 451 F.3d 241, 243 (D.C.Cir.2006).
Tribune argues that it was error for the NLRB panel to find that Tribune and the Union entered into a new agreement when the Company agreed to deduct union dues by way of direct deposit.   Rather, Tribune contends, when it allowed its employees to directly deposit their union dues after expiration of the union contract, it was reinstituting the dues checkoff provision in that expired union contract.   The Company, noting that the expired union contract provided for the withholding of union dues from employee paychecks, contends that this was in fact what direct deposit of union dues accomplished.   Consequently, argues Tribune, dues checkoff and direct deposit of union dues are one and the same and the Company is privileged to discontinue either in the context of an expired union contract.   Putting it another way, the Company asserts that, because it had the right to discontinue payroll deduction of union dues upon expiration of the union contract, when it stopped direct deposit of union dues it “[o]nce again ․ exercised its right, in the context of an expired Collective Bargaining Agreement, to cease deducting money from the wages of employees in payment of membership dues to the union.”   Even if an oral agreement was reached, argues Tribune, if an employer can cease payroll deduction of union dues upon expiration of a union contract which contained an express provision for union dues deduction, “then surely the employer has the same right to cease payroll deduction of union dues pursuant [to] an informal oral agreement reached during a contract hiatus.”
The NLRB responds by first noting that pursuant to §§ 8(a)(5) and (d) of the Act, it is an unfair labor practice for an employer “to refuse to bargain collectively with the representatives of his employees” with respect to “wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment.”   The NLRB asserts that this provision bars an employer from unilaterally discontinuing terms and conditions of employment that concern a mandatory subject of
