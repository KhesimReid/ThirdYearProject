This lawsuit concerns the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act (“Ryan White Act” or the “Act”), Pub.L. No. 101–381, 104 Stat. 576 (1990) (codified at 42 U.S.C. § 300ff et seq.). Under “Part A” of the Act, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) disburses funding to combat HIV/AIDS infection in metropolitan areas that are home to more than a specified number of individuals who have AIDS. 42 U.S.C. § 300ff–11(a). This lawsuit arose because HHS recently determined that the Ponce metropolitan area no longer has enough AIDS cases to qualify for continued Part A funding. Joined by several community health groups, Ponce claims that HHS has unfairly drawn the boundaries of Ponce's metropolitan area too narrowly, and that the addition of three adjoining communities would raise the total number of AIDS cases enough to qualify for continued funding. Confronted with what it correctly recognized as largely unhelpful briefing by the parties, the district court agreed with Ponce in part and declared that the boundaries of the Ponce area were “unlawful as they now stand.” Municipio Autónomo de Ponce v. U.S. Office of Mgmt. & Budget, 40 F.Supp.3d 222, 234 (D.P.R.2014), reconsideration denied, No. 3:14–CV–01502 JAF, 2014 WL 4639896 (D.P.R. Sept. 16, 2014) (“Ponce”). Because we agree with HHS that Congress can reasonably be said to have dictated that HHS use the boundaries that it uses in defining the Ponce metropolitan area, we reverse.1
I. BACKGROUND
The Act originally defined “metropolitan area” to be “an area referred to in the HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a metropolitan area.” 42 U.S.C. § 300ff–17(2) (1992); see also id. § 300ff–19(d)(3) (explicitly adopting the § 300ff–17 definitions for the subsection relevant to Ponce). When Congress enacted this definition, the CDC used the Office of Management and Budget's (“OMB”) delineations of geographical Metropolitan Statistical Areas (“MSAs”) in its Surveillance Reports. See Ctr. Disease Control, Dept. Health & Human. Servs., HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report 21 (Jan.1990). Accordingly, the practical effect of the manner in which Congress defined “metropolitan area” was to require HHS to use as its metropolitan areas under the Act the MSAs developed by OMB, unless and until CDC started using some other definition in its surveillance reports. And CDC has in fact continued to use OMB's MSAs in its surveillance reports. See, e.g., Ctr. Disease Control, Dept. Health & Human Servs., HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report 18 (July 1993) (hereinafter, “1993 Surveillance Report ”); Ctr. Disease Control, Dept. Health & Human Servs., HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report 14 (2013).
For its own purposes, OMB has delineated the boundaries of MSAs (under various names) since the 1940s. See 2010 Standards for Delineating Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Areas, 75 Fed.Reg. 37,246, 37,246 (June 28, 2010) (hereinafter “2010 MSA Standards”). OMB's standards for arriving at the delineations and the MSAs themselves are published decennially in the Federal Register. See Revised Standards for Defining Metropolitan Areas in the 1990's, 55 Fed.Reg. 12154–01 (Mar. 30, 1990) (hereinafter, “1990 MSA Standards”). The delineations are issued according to OMB's general statutory mandate to “develop and oversee the implementation of Governmentwide [sic] policies, principles, standards, and guidelines concerning—(A) statistical collection procedures and methods; (B) statistical data classification; (C) statistical information presentation and dissemination; [etc.].” 44 U.S.C. § 3504(e)(3); see also 31 U.S.C. § 1104(d) (overlapping, similar statutory mandate).
OMB has made it clear that it developed the MSAs to be used “solely for statistical purposes” and they might not be suitable for allocating funding. 2010 MSA Standards at 37,246.2 The CDC, though, does not make the Ryan White Act funding decisions. Nor did it “select” OMB's MSAs to be used for that purpose. The CDC uses the MSAs as they were intended: for the purpose of gathering statistics. It did so before and when the Act was enacted; and there is no hint in the Act at all that the CDC needed to set aside its own purposes in selecting how to define “metropolitan areas.”
Under OMB's 1993 delineation used by CDC in its 1993 Report and, thus, used by HHS to award Part A grants in fiscal year 1994, Puerto Rico was divided into four “metropolitan areas”: the “Combined Metropolitan Area” of San Juan, which includes 38 of the island's 78 communities, and three other “Metropolitan Statistical Areas,” one of which is comprised of Ponce and five other communities. As thus delineated, Ponce initially qualified as eligible to receive funding under the Act. In 1996, however, Congress raised the eligibility requirements,3 enough so that Ponce's number of AIDS cases no longer rendered it eligible. Nevertheless, for a decade Ponce continued to receive funding as if it were eligible based on a grandfathering provision included in the 1996 legislation. 42 U.S.C. § 300ff–11(d) (2000), as amended by Ryan White CARE Act Amendments of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104–146, § 3(d), 110 Stat. 1346, 1347 (1996) (amended 2006, 2009).
In 2006 Congress removed the grandfathering provision, but Ponce still managed to receive funding under the newly-created category of “transitional [grant] area[s].” Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Modernization Act of 2006, Pub.L. No. 109–415, §§ 101, 2609, 120 Stat. 2767, 2768, 2781–83 (2006) (codified in part at 42 U.S.C. § 300ff–19 (2012) (amended 2009)). A transitional grant area is defined as a metropolitan area “for which there has been reported to and confirmed by the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention a cumulative total of at least 1,000, but fewer than 2,000, cases of AIDS during the most recent period of 5 calendar years․” Id. Under the current amended statute, a metropolitan area ceases to be eligible as a transitional grant area if, in each of three consecutive years, it fails to have more than 1,000 and less than 2,000 reported AIDS cases in the preceding five years, id. § 300ff–19(c)(2)(A)(i), and fails to have a cumulative total of at least 1,400 living AIDS cases in the most recent calendar year,4 id. §§ 300ff–19(c)(2)(A)(ii), (2)(B); see generally County of Nassau v. Leavitt, 524 F.3d 408 (2d Cir.2008).
In the 1996 legislation, and then as refined in the 2006 legislation, Congress also froze the boundaries of the metropolitan areas to be used by HHS. Ryan White Amendments of 1996 § 101. For metropolitan areas that received funding as “eligible areas” in 2006, “the boundaries of such metropolitan area shall be the boundaries that were in effect for such area for fiscal year 1994,” 42 U.S.C. § 300ff–11(c)(1), while for metropolitan areas that become “eligible areas” after fiscal year 2006, “the boundaries of such metropolitan area shall be the boundaries that are in effect for such area when such area initially receives funding ․,” id. § 300ff–11(c)(2). The 2006 amendments, however, did not so directly dictate which year's boundaries should be used for metropolitan areas like Ponce that were no longer eligible areas for funding under 42 U.S.C. § 300ff–11(a), but were instead receiving funding as “transitional areas” under § 300ff–19. HHS nevertheless applies the same approach to transitional areas (all of which were once eligible areas), and supports this consistent approach by appealing to administrative convenience and “continuity of care,” noting that acting otherwise would lead to overlapping “eligible” and “transitional” areas and confound Congress's scheme. Ponce offers no rejoinder to this conclusion.5
By fiscal year 2014, the number of cumulative AIDS cases and the number of living AIDS cases within the Ponce metropolitan area as delineated in the 1993 OMB MSA had dropped enough for a long enough period of time that HHS notified Ponce that it no longer qualified for transitional funding.
