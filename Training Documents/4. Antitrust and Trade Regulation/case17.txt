Plaintiff-Appellant Amphastar Pharmaceuticals Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary International Medication Systems Ltd. (collectively, “Amphastar”) appeal from the district court's dismissal of their complaint alleging antitrust violations by Defendant-Appellees Sandoz Inc. (“Sandoz”) and Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Momenta”). Amphastar and Sandoz are competitors in the United States market for generic enoxaparin, an anticoagulant. Momenta serves as Sandoz's contract laboratory.
Amphastar's suit is predicated upon the defendants' alleged misrepresentations to the United States Pharmacopeial Convention (“USP”), a private standard-setting organization (“SSO”) charged with ensuring the quality of drugs. According to the complaint, the defendants, in violation of a duty imposed by the USP, knowingly failed to disclose to the standard-setting body that a proposed method for testing generic enoxaparin might be covered by Momenta's pending patent application. The USP, in reliance on the defendants' misrepresentations, adopted the method, and the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) required Amphastar to comply with it.
The defendants promptly brought an infringement suit against Amphastar, resulting in a temporary restraining order (“TRO”) and subsequent preliminary injunction prohibiting Amphastar from selling enoxaparin. Although the preliminary injunction was ultimately vacated, it did prevent Amphastar from selling its generic enoxaparin for a period of roughly three months.
Amphastar responded with the instant suit under the Sherman Act, see 15 U.S.C. §§ 1, 2, seeking damages for profits lost during the pendency of the TRO and injunction. The district court dismissed Amphastar's complaint under the so-called Noerr-Pennington doctrine, which immunizes good-faith petitioning of government entities from antitrust liability. Because its Noerr-Pennington ruling was dispositive, the court expressly declined to address the defendants' other arguments for dismissal. We hold that the district court erroneously applied Noerr-Pennington. Accordingly, we reverse the dismissal of Amphastar's complaint and remand for the district court to consider the defendants' other arguments in the first instance.
I.
In reviewing the district court's dismissal under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), we take as true the facts from the well-pled allegations in Amphastar's complaint. See, e.g., In re Loestrin 24 Fe Antitrust Litig., 814 F.3d 538, 549 (1st Cir. 2016).
In November 2003, Sandoz and Momenta entered into a collaboration agreement for the development and commercialization of enoxaparin. The agreement granted Sandoz an exclusive license to Momenta's (as yet unissued) United States Patent No. 7,575,886 (“'886 patent”). It also created heavy incentives to ensure that Sandoz remained the sole provider of generic enoxaparin, including milestone and profit share payments to Momenta. Sandoz benefited because, as long as it was the only generic entrant in the market, it would be able to price enoxaparin at close to brand levels.
In early 2007, the USP began the process of establishing standards for enoxaparin, including a testing method to determine whether the relevant criteria have been met. Ultimately, in late 2009, the USP would adopt Method < 207> (“Method 207”) as the testing standard. Federal law requires that pharmaceutical products comply with applicable USP standards. See 21 U.S.C. § 351(b).
USP policy requires all members and participants in the standard-setting process to disclose any potential conflicts of interest, including intellectual property rights. The USP staff typically reviews these conflict of interest policies at the beginning of panel meetings. Dr. Zachary Shriver, a Momenta employee who would later be named as an inventor on the '886 patent, represented Momenta on the USP panels involved in developing the enoxaparin standard. Sandoz also participated in the panel discussions.
During the standard-setting process, the USP was unaware of the pending '886 patent application. After the patent issued in August 2009, the defendants would take the position that it covered Method 207. Notwithstanding this potential conflict, the defendants failed to disclose the pending application to the USP.
The defendants' failure to disclose their own potential conflict stands in sharp contrast to their vigilance in raising a similar issue relating to Sanofi-Aventis (“Aventis”). In 1995, Aventis had obtained approval for the original branded version of enoxaparin. During the standard-setting process, the defendants complained to the USP that Aventis had a pending patent application that, if issued, would potentially cover Method 207. The USP accordingly persuaded Aventis to allow its application to lapse. Subsequently, the USP staff reported that it was “not aware of any patent issue that may cover the test.”
In December 2009, the USP approved and adopted Method 207. The method thus became “the official test method that the FDA required of Amphastar to test ․ its enoxaparin in order to obtain and maintain its generic enoxaparin approval.” Sandoz became the first entity to receive FDA approval to sell generic enoxaparin in July 2010. Amphastar received approval in September 2011.
Just two days after Amphastar's approval, the defendants filed the suit, mentioned earlier, claiming infringement of the '886 patent. The district court issued a TRO on October 7, 2011, and a preliminary injunction on October 28. The TRO and subsequent injunction prohibited Amphastar from selling enoxaparin. The injunction was stayed (and later vacated) on appeal by the Federal Circuit on January 25, 2012. See Momenta Pharm., Inc. v. Amphastar Pharm., Inc., 686 F.3d 1348, 1352, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2012).
In September 2015, Amphastar filed the instant antitrust action, seeking damages for profits lost during the pendency of the TRO and preliminary injunction entered in the infringement suit. Amphastar initially filed in the Central District of California, but the case was later transferred to the District of Massachusetts. After the transfer, the district court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss.
In dismissing the complaint, the court relied exclusively upon the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, which immunizes from antitrust liability “valid efforts to elicit favorable government action ․ even if the ultimate purpose or incidental consequence of the efforts is an anti-competitive restraint on trade.” The court noted that Amphastar's claimed injuries resulted from the injunction issued in the patent infringement case. It then went on to find “that the asserted injuries arise from the FDA's purported adoption of the 207 Method” and, for that reason, Noerr-Pennington barred the antitrust claims. The court rejected Amphastar's argument that the defendants' misrepresentations to the USP deprived them of immunity. Finally, the district judge expressly “decline[d] to address [the defendants'] other arguments for dismissal” because its Noerr-Pennington ruling was “dispositive.”
II.
We review the dismissal of Amphastar's complaint de novo. See, e.g., Loestrin, 814 F.3d at 549. Applying this standard, we hold that the district court erred in dismissing the complaint under Noerr-Pennington.
The Noerr-Pennington doctrine provides that a Sherman Act violation cannot be “predicated upon mere attempts to influence the passage or enforcement of laws.” E. R.R. Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 135 (1961); see also United Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 670 (1965) (“Joint efforts to influence public officials do not violate the antitrust laws even though intended to eliminate competition.”). While Noerr and Pennington dealt with petitioning of the legislative and executive branches, the Court later held that “[t]he same philosophy governs the approach of citizens ․ to administrative agencies ․ and to courts.” Cal. Motor Transp. Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, 404 U.S. 508, 510 (1972). Here, the defendants argue that Noerr-Pennington protects their petitioning of the federal court in the i
