Plaintiff Roger D. Gripe appeals the district court's order dismissing his complaint as a sanction for his lawyer's repeated violations of court orders and rules.   The district court denied plaintiff's motion for relief from judgment.   Because the statute of limitations on his claims has expired, he cannot refile them.   Plaintiff's principal argument is that he should not be penalized for his lawyer's shortcomings.   We affirm.1
Appellate Jurisdiction
As a preliminary matter, we discuss our jurisdiction.   The district court dismissed the action on November 1, 2001.   Plaintiff filed a motion for relief from judgment on November 2, and filed a timely notice of appeal from the order of dismissal on November 30.   On December 19 the district court denied relief from the judgment.   Plaintiff did not file an amended notice of appeal, as required by Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4)(B)(ii) to challenge a post-judgment order.   Therefore, we have appellate jurisdiction over only the November 1 judgment of dismissal and not over the December 19 order denying post-judgment relief.  Jernigan v. Stuchell, 304 F.3d 1030, 1031 (10th Cir.2002).   Accordingly, we do not address plaintiff's appellate arguments related to the post-judgment proceedings.   The post-judgment order does, however, reveal some of the district court's reasons for dismissing the case, and we consider it for that purpose.   It would be pointless to remand for a statement of reasons when those reasons have already been expressed on the record.
Facts
Plaintiff, a police officer, filed his original complaint on September 11, 1998.   The complaint alleged that his federal civil rights and various state-law rights were violated when defendant Dillards, a department store, and its manager wrongfully caused him to be investigated for assaulting his wife, who was a store employee. It further alleged that the City of Enid, its police chief, and police captain Tim Goodpasture wrongfully pursued assault charges against him as punishment for his involvement in a police collective bargaining unit.
The district court dismissed the complaint without prejudice on January 15, 1999, because plaintiff had not taken any action in the litigation, having failed even to perfect service on the defendants.   Plaintiff refiled on January 14, 2000.   By this time the applicable limitations period apparently had expired.   Although the Oklahoma savings statute provides that the statute of limitations does not bar a refiled complaint if the original complaint was timely filed and the refiling occurs within a year of a non-merits dismissal of the original complaint, Okla. Stat. tit. 12, § 100, the second complaint did not invoke this statute.   Consequently, on February 7, 2000, the City and its police chief moved to dismiss the action on the ground that the statute of limitations had run.
On September 29, 2000, the district court ruled that plaintiff would be allowed to file an amended complaint to cure his failure to invoke the Oklahoma savings statute.   Plaintiff was granted fifteen days to file an amended complaint.   Plaintiff missed the deadline.   On January 12, 2001, the district court ordered plaintiff to file an amended complaint, or show cause for a failure to do so, no later than January 18, 2001.   The order expressed the court's concern that no effort had been made to comply with its prior deadline and warned that failure to comply with the second order could result in dismissal of the action with prejudice.   Plaintiff filed no pleading by the January 18 deadline.
On January 23 plaintiff filed an amended complaint accompanied by a motion to file it out of time.   Although plaintiff had entered into a stipulated dismissal of defendant Goodpasture in June 2000, the amended complaint again named him as a defendant.   Plaintiff's attorney claimed his tardiness was due to inadvertence, miscalendaring of the due date by his office, and a family emergency.
On May 22, 2001, over objection, the district court allowed the amended complaint to stand.   The court stated that it was “troubled by plaintiff's counsel's inability to comply with the court's orders in a timely and professional manner,” but would let the case proceed because of “the harshness of dismissal and the court's preference for determining cases on their merits.”   Aplt.App. doc. 15, at 101-02.   The court issued the following warning:
[T]he court expects and directs plaintiff's counsel to fully comply with all orders of the court and to comply with all applicable federal and local rules.   Further instances of “inadvertently overlooking” court deadlines and similar requirements will be met with the utmost disapproval and possible sanctions, including, if appropriate, dismissal of this action.
Id. at 102.   The court imposed no sanction except to order plaintiff to file a second amended complaint omitting Goodpasture and to pay Goodpasture's attorney fees for having to respond to the amended complaint.   Plaintiff complied with the order.
On November 1, 2001, plaintiff's attorney failed to appear at a court-ordered status conference.   Defense counsel did appear.   The court dismissed the action, finding that plaintiff's counsel had been given sufficient notice that the case would be dismissed for continued failure to comply with the court's orders and applicable rules and that the inconvenience and expense to the other parties and the court warranted dismissal.
Plaintiff filed a motion for relief from judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b), and later supplemented the motion with an affidavit from his attorney.   Plaintiff's attorney sought to excuse his failure to comply with the court's order to appear at the status conference by pointing to his personal obligations and busy litigation schedule.   In denying relief, the district court observed that in addition to failing to appear at the status conference, plaintiff's attorney had “a disturbing history of missed deadlines and noncompliance with the court's orders in this case.”  Id. doc. 30, at 266.   The court held that plaintiff had failed to justify his request for relief under Rule 60(b), in part because there was no reason to believe that another warning would be effective.   The court further held that dismissal did not penalize plaintiff unjustly because he had chosen the attorney who had repeatedly failed to comply with court orders and rules.   Plaintiff appeals, claiming dismissal was too harsh a sanction under the circumstances.
Analysis
The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure authorize sanctions, including dismissal, for failing to appear at a pretrial or scheduling conference, see Fed.R.Civ.P. 16(f) and 37(b)(2)(C), and for failing to comply with court rules or any order of the court, see Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b).  As stated in an en banc opinion of this court, Rule 16(f) “indicates the intent to give courts very broad discretion to use sanctions where necessary to insure ․ that lawyers and parties ․ fulfill their high duty to insure the expeditious and sound management of the preparation of cases for trial.”  Mulvaney v. Rivair Flying Serv., Inc. (In re Baker), 744 F.2d 1438, 1440 (10th Cir.1984) (en banc).
 We review for an abuse of discretion the district court's decision to impose the sanction of dismissal for failure to follow court orders and rules.  Archibeque v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Co., 70 F.3d 1172, 1174 (10th Cir.1995).  “It is within a court's discretion to dismiss a case if, after considering all the relevant factors, it concludes that dismissal alone would satisfy the interests of justice.”  Ehrenhaus v. Reynolds, 965 F.2d 916, 918 (10th Cir.1992).
 Before imposing dismissal as a sanction, a district court should ordinarily evaluate the following factors on the record:  “(1) the degree of actual prejudice to the [other party];  (2) the amount of interference with the judicial process;  ․ (3) the culpability of the litigant;  (4) whether the court warned the party in advance that dismissal of the action would be a li
