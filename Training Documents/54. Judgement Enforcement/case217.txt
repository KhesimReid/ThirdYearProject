In case No. 01-6377, Southwestern Bell Telephone Company (SBTC), garnishee, appeals from a judgment holding it liable to garnishors William A. Strong and Carolyn E. Strong (Strongs), for funds SBTC paid to the judgment debtor, Donald D. Laubach.1  In case No. 01-6409, Mr. Laubach appeals from a judgment in favor of the Strongs, limiting the exemption on workers' compensation proceeds he received to $50,000.   Pursuant to 10th Cir. R. 27.1 and Okla. Stat. tit. 20, §§ 1601-11, we certified a question of state law to the Oklahoma Supreme Court.   That question has been answered and, exercising our jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291, we reverse the district court's order limiting the available exemption for workers' compensation proceeds to $50,000, and remand for further proceedings.2
FACTS
While an employee of SBTC, Mr. Laubach was injured in two separate accidents.   He filed workers' compensation claims against SBTC that were settled in three stages.   Mr. Laubach received the sum of $368.90 every two weeks from March 4, 1998 through August 5, 1998.   He then entered into a settlement which provided in part for a lump sum payment to him in the amount of $221,374.00.   Finally, Liberty Mutual Insurance Company issued an annuity on behalf of Mr. Laubach in the amount of $40,774.00, which was to pay Mr. Laubach the sum of $425.00 per month for a period of ten years.
In 1994, the Strongs obtained a default judgment against Laubach in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri, in the amount of $484,432.29.   In 1995, they filed this judgment in the Western District of Oklahoma.   Since 1998, the Strongs have attempted to garnish the workers' compensation benefits awarded to Mr. Laubach.
The Strongs filed a garnishment targeting Mr. Laubach's bank account (the “November 1998” garnishment).   Mr. Laubach responded to the bank account garnishment by claiming exemptions for social security benefits and workers' compensation proceeds.   On January 6, 1999, a magistrate judge assigned to the case entered an report and recommendation granting Mr. Laubach's claim for exemption, to the extent that the garnisheed proceeds represented social security benefits.   The magistrate judge also concluded, however, that Mr. Laubach's exemption for workers' compensation benefits was limited to $50,000.
Mr. Laubach filed an objection to the magistrate judge's report and recommendation, contending that he was entitled to an unlimited exemption.   On August 21, 2000, the district court entered an order rejecting the objection.
In the meantime, on or about March 5, 1998, the Strongs had issued a continuing garnishment summons against SBTC (the “March 1998 garnishment”), seeking to intercept workers' compensation proceeds it held on Mr. Laubach's behalf.   This garnishment summons was served on SBTC's Missouri agent for service of process, by certified mail, return receipt requested, restricted delivery.   SBTC responded with a letter to the Strongs' counsel objecting to the service of the summons in Missouri.   SBTC's letter also contended that any workers' compensation proceeds paid to Mr. Laubach were entirely exempt from garnishment pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 85, § 48.   SBTC did not file an answer to the garnishment and took no immediate court action to quash the garnishment.
On January 15, 1999, the Strongs filed a motion with the district court requesting that a judgment be issued against SBTC for the entire amount of the underlying principal judgment, plus interest, costs and attorney's fees, due to SBTC's failure to answer the March 1998 garnishment.   The district court entered an order on January 21, 1999, requiring SBTC to answer the garnishment summons, to render an accounting of all compensation paid to Mr. Laubach during the effective date of the garnishment, and to show cause for its failure to pay sums sought in the garnishment.
On August 23, 2000, the district court issued an order finding that the Strongs had effected sufficient service of the March 1998 garnishment summons on SBTC. On January 25, 2001, after an evidentiary hearing, the district court entered an order finding SBTC liable for the amount of funds paid to Mr. Laubach during the 180-day period the garnishment was in effect.   The court found, however, that this amount should be offset by Mr. Laubach's $50,000 exemption for workers' compensation proceeds.   Finally, it determined there was only one $50,000 exemption available, and it had been exhausted in the March 1998 garnishment proceeding.
Mr. Laubach filed a motion for a new trial and/or to alter or amend the judgment.   He contended that the exemption should have been unlimited under Okla. Stat. tit. 85, § 48.   In support of his argument, Mr. Laubach cited an Oklahoma Court of Civil Appeals decision, Young v. Rimer, 964 P.2d 911, 912 (Okla.Ct.App.1997), limited by Strong v. Laubach, 2004 WL 615674 (Okla. Mar.30, 2004), for the proposition that workers' compensation funds paid to the employee are subject to an unlimited exemption, while those paid to others who have an interest in the proceeds are limited to the $50,000 exemption.
On October 18, 2001, the district court entered an order denying Mr. Laubach's motion.   Both Mr. Laubach and SBTC have appealed from the district court's determination that the exemption is limited to $50,000.3
We certified the following question of state law to the Oklahoma Supreme Court:
Whether workers' compensation proceeds paid to an injured worker are entirely exempt from garnishment, as provided in Okla. Stat. tit. 85, § 48, or whether the exemption is limited to fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00), as provided in Okla. Stat. tit. 31, § 1(A)(21).
The Oklahoma Supreme Court restated the question as follows:
Are workers' compensation proceeds paid to an injured worker entirely exempt from garnishment, as provided in Okla. Stat. tit. 85, § 48, or is the exemption limited to fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), as provided in Okla. Stat. tit. 31, § 1(A)(21)?
Strong, 89 P.3d 1066, 2004 WL 615674, at *1.
In response to the certified question, it concluded:
Claims for compensation or benefits due are completely exempt under 85 O.S.2001 § 48, the exclusive statutory authority for exemptions under the Workers' Compensation Act, 85 O.S.2001 §§ 1 et seq.  The purported exemptions for a “person's interest in a ․ workers' compensation claim”, under 31 O.S.2001 § 1(A)(21), shall not apply to “claims for compensation or benefits due” under the Oklahoma Workers' Compensation Act.

ANALYSIS
1. Issues previously resolved in certification order
In our order certifying the question of state law to the Oklahoma Supreme Court, we considered the following procedural issues pertinent to this appeal:
1. Whether SBTC was released from liability for the garnishment proceeds merely because Mr. Laubach was no longer employed by SBTC at the time it paid him workers' compensation benefits.
2. Whether the procedure utilized by the Strongs to obtain service of process of their garnishment on SBTC provided SBTC with actual notice of the garnishment and was sufficient to confer jurisdiction over SBTC in the garnishment action.
We now reaffirm our prior holding on each of these issues.
 A. Laubach's employment status
 SBTC argues it is not liable for the garnishment proceeds because Mr. Laubach was no longer employed by SBTC at the time it paid him workers' compensation benefits.   The continuing earnings garnishment statute defines “earnings” subject to garnishment broadly, to include “any form of payment to an individual.”  Okla. Stat. tit. 12, § 1173.4(A).
SBTC points out that a continuing earnings garnishment terminates with the employment relationship.  Id. § 1173.4(G)(2).  That is true a fortiori where wages are garnished, and the termination of the employment relationship ends the employer's responsibility for compensating the employee with wages that may be garnished.   Where “earnings” other than wages are paid, however, the termination of the emp
