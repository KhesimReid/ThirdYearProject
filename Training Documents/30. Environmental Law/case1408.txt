Petitioner Delaware seeks review of two FERC orders by which the Commission conditionally approved an application to site, construct, and operate a liquid natural gas terminal near the mouth of the Delaware River.   We dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction:  Delaware lacks standing because it has not suffered an injury-in-fact.
I
In September 2004, Crown Landing LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of BP America Production Company, filed an application with the Commission to site, construct, and operate a liquid natural gas import terminal at the mouth of the Delaware River.   Onshore portions of the proposed project were to be located in New Jersey, but a pier designed for the unloading of tanker ships was planned to extend beyond New Jersey waters into that portion of the river which appertains to neighboring Delaware.1
Section 3 of the Natural Gas Act (“NGA”), 15 U.S.C. § 717b(a) et seq., prohibits the importation of foreign natural gas without prior authorization by the Commission.   As amended,2 the NGA confers upon the Commission the authority to approve or deny applications for the “siting, construction, expansion, or operation of a [liquid natural gas] terminal.”   With certain limitations, irrelevant here, approval orders may be issued conditionally as the Commission deems necessary or appropriate.
The NGA specifically provides for the protection of rights granted to the states under the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (“CZMA”), 16 U.S.C. § 1451 et seq., and the Clean Air Act (“CAA”), 42 U.S.C. § 7401 et seq.   Although the mechanisms differ, both of these statutes mandate that federal licensing authorities ensure compliance by proposed projects with relevant state-based environmental programs.
The CZMA tasks the states with the development of coastal zone protection programs in exchange for federal funding incentives.   Upon approval of such a program by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, any applicant for a federal license to conduct activities in a coastal zone must certify that the proposed activity complies with the program adopted by the affected state.   A copy of this certification must be furnished to the relevant state agency, which must inform the federal government within six months whether or not it concurs with the certification.   Ordinarily, no license may be granted absent state approval of this compliance certification.3  However, if the Secretary of Commerce concludes, whether on his own initiative or upon appeal by the applicant, that the project is consistent with the objectives of the CZMA or otherwise necessary on national security grounds, the state's pre-approval rights may be preempted and the project may proceed.
The CAA similarly requires each state to adopt a plan to implement, maintain, and enforce national air quality standards within the state.   Once the Environmental Protection Agency has approved of a state plan, no department or agency of the federal government is authorized to license any activity that fails to conform with the plan.   Federal agencies bear an “affirmative responsibility” to ensure that any proposed project conforms with the applicable state plan prior to approval.   Under this statute, there is no provision permitting a federal official to override a state, but, on the other hand, there also does not appear to be any mechanism for the state specifically to disapprove a project.
Crown Landing did not file a CZMA certification with Delaware but did request a status decision from the state (we gather that a status decision is, in effect, a preliminary, yet preemptive, decision).   On February 3, 2005, the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, petitioner here, issued its decision and rejected the project.   On appeal, Delaware's Coastal Zone Industrial Control Board unanimously affirmed that decision.   Meanwhile, New Jersey filed an original action before the Supreme Court challenging Delaware's jurisdiction to regulate the Crown Landing terminal pursuant to its authority under the CZMA. The Supreme Court confirmed that Delaware indeed possesses this authority.  New Jersey v. Delaware, ---U.S. ----, ---- - ----, 128 S.Ct. 1410, 1427-8, 170 L.Ed.2d 315 (2008).
On June 20, 2006, the Commission issued an order approving Crown Landing's application subject to some sixty-seven conditions precedent.4  The Commission acknowledged that the Crown Landing proposal is subject to coastal zone consistency reviews in New Jersey, Delaware, and Pennsylvania and thus concluded that the company must obtain the concurrence of the relevant state agencies prior to Commission approval of the commencement of construction.   See Conditional Approval Order at ¶ 62,391;  see also id. at ¶ 62,386.   Accordingly, final approval by the Commission is subject to the condition that documentation of concurrence by the state of Delaware evidencing the consistency of the project with the state's Coastal Management Program be submitted by the company “prior to construction.”  Id. App. A, at ¶ 20 (emphasis in original).   The order contains a parallel condition requiring pre-construction submission of an air quality analysis specifically demonstrating conformity with applicable state implementation plans under the CAA. Id. App. A, at ¶ 22.
Delaware requested agency rehearing on the basis that the Commission had exceeded its statutory authority by approving the application under its NGA powers before the requirements of the CZMA and CAA had been satisfied.   In Delaware's view, issuance of an approval order-conditionally or otherwise-is ultra vires conduct unless the Commission has first ensured compliance with relevant state environmental programs.   Rehearing was denied.   Order Denying Rehearing and Issuing Clarification, Crown Landing LLC, Docket No. CP04-411-001, 117 FERC ¶ 61,209 (Nov. 17, 2006).   Delaware's petition for review before this Court, filed in January 2007, was held in abeyance pending resolution New Jersey's original action before the Supreme Court.   Then the Commission, joined by Crown Landing, moved to dismiss Delaware's petition on grounds of non-justiciability and lack of standing.   We ordered the case restored to the oral argument calendar, deferred the dismissal motions, and ordered the parties to revisit their merits briefs in light of the Supreme Court's intervening decision.
II
As noted, FERC, along with intervenor Crown Landing, challenges Delaware's standing, asserting that the state lacks an injury-in-fact, because FERC's order is explicitly conditioned on state approval under the CZMA (and CAA).   Indeed, the state has already exercised its CZMA authority to reject the project, which has received the imprimatur of the Supreme Court.   See New Jersey, 128 S.Ct. at 1427-28.   Delaware responds that it has suffered an injury because it was entitled under both statutes to block the project before FERC even proceeded to consider the matter.   In other words, FERC lacked statutory authority to issue a conditional order, even if that condition preserved Delaware's right to veto the project.
Delaware argues that the CZMA unambiguously grants the state priority in the approval process.   The statute reads in relevant part:  “[n]o license or permit shall be granted by the Federal agency until the state or its designated agency has concurred with the applicant's certification.”  16 U.S.C. § 1456(c)(3)(A).   The CAA contains similar language.  42 U.S.C. § 7506(c)(1).   The merits therefore depend upon whether FERC's conditional approval order constitutes a “license or permit” within the meaning of these statutes.
Of course, in considering standing, we must assume the validity of Delaware's merits argument, i.e., that FERC violated the statutory scheme by going ahead and issuing a conditional order, because Delaware had a statutory right to go first (i.e., Alphonse ahead of Gaston).   See Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 500, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975);  see also Emergency Coalition t
