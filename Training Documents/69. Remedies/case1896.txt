OPINION AND ORDER GRANTING PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE
Unlike a cat, the mechanic's lien here has one life, not nine.
Asphalt Professionals, Inc. (API), the real party in interest, contracted with petitioners T.O. IX, LLC, and D and S Homes, Inc., to build a street through a nine-home subdivision developed by petitioners.   API alleges that it has not been paid $79,831.18 due under the contract.   It recorded a mechanic's lien against each of the nine parcels for the full amount due under the contract:  nine separate liens, at $79,831.18 each, to secure API's right to be paid once.   After API filed this action to foreclose on the mechanics' liens, petitioners filed a motion to remove the liens as willfully overstated, pursuant to Civil Code section 3118.1  The trial court denied the motion.   Petitioners then applied ex parte for an order permitting them to release all nine parcels from the liens by posting a single surety bond in an amount equal to one and one-half times the total amount of API's claim, as provided in section 3143.   The trial court denied the application.
 Petitioners filed this petition for a writ of mandate to direct the trial court to grant either the motion to remove the liens or the ex parte application to post a single surety bond.   We issued an order to show cause.   API filed a return by demurrer and an answer to the writ petition.   We overrule API's return by demurrer to the order to show cause.   Petitioners have standing to defend the causes of action alleged against them by API. (See, e.g., §§ 3128, 3153.)   We grant the writ petition.   The superior court shall vacate its order denying petitioners' ex parte application.   It shall enter a new order authorizing petitioners to post a single surety bond in the amount mandated by section 3143 to release the nine mechanics' liens at issue in this litigation.
Statutory Framework
The mechanic's lien is the only creditor's remedy under California law that stems from a constitutional mandate to create a lien for “the value of such labor done and material furnished” and to provide by statute “for the speedy and efficient enforcement of such liens.”  (Cal. Const., art.   XIV, § 3.) Our mechanics' lien statutes, section 3082 et seq., carry out the constitutional mandate by providing that contractors and other specified workers who provide labor, materials, equipment and other services to a work of improvement, “shall have a lien” on the property on which they worked “for the value of such labor done or materials furnished․” (§ 3110.)   The amount of the lien is limited to the “reasonable value of the labor, services, equipment, or materials furnished or for the price agreed upon by the claimant and the person with whom he or she contracted, whichever is less.” (§ 3123, subd. (a).)  It is forfeited by anyone “who shall willfully include in his claim of lien labor, services, equipment or materials not furnished for the property described in such claim.” (§ 3118.)
If a single lien is recorded against multiple works of improvement that are owned or were contracted for by the same person, the claimant must designate the amount due on each work of improvement, or lose priority to other liens. (§ 3130.)   If the claimant is to be paid a lump sum for multiple works of improvement that are owned or were contracted for by the same person, and the contract does not segregate the amount due for each work of improvement separately, the claimant “may estimate an equitable distribution of the sum due him over all of such works of improvement․” (Ibid.) Finally, “if there is a single structure on more than one parcel of land owned by one or more different owners, it shall not be the duty of the claimant to segregate the proportion of material or labor entering into the structure on any one of such parcels;  but upon the trial thereof the court may, where it deems it equitable so to do, distribute the lien equitably as between the several parcels involved.”  (Ibid.)
 A property owner who “disputes the correctness or validity of any claim of lien” may record “a bond ․, in a penal sum equal to 1 1/2 times the amount of the claim or 1 1/2 times the amount allocated in the claim of lien to the parcel or parcels of real property sought to be released․ Upon the recording of such bond the real property described in such bond is released from the lien and from any action to foreclose such lien․” (§ 3143.)   The surety bond will, in many cases, be the property owner's most effective protection against an unjustified or overstated mechanics' lien.   It may not, however, “be available to an individual owner, who will usually be required to post liquid collateral in the amount of the bond.”  (Lambert v. Superior Court (1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 383, 386, 279 Cal.Rptr. 32.)   Recording a surety bond “does not deprive the lien claimant of its constitutional right to a lien and instead provides for the speedy and efficient enforcement of the lien.   The recording of the release bond does not extinguish the lien;  rather, the bond is substituted for the land as the object to which the lien attaches, with the lien transferred from the land to the bond.”  (Royster Construction Co. v. Urban West Communities (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1158, 1166, 47 Cal.Rptr.2d 684.)
Statutory Construction
 Well settled rules of statutory construction require us to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature in enacting the mechanics' lien law.   (Friedman v. City of Beverly Hills (1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 436, 441, 54 Cal.Rptr.2d 882.)   Initially, we refer to the plain meaning of the words used to ascertain the Legislature's intent, and we give those terms their ordinary, common meaning.  (Ibid.) “Where a statute is reasonably susceptible to two interpretations, the court must adopt the one that is consistent with the apparent legislative purpose and intent and that, when applied, will result in wise policy rather than absurd or harsh results.   (County of San Diego v. Muniz (1978) 22 Cal.3d 29 [148 Cal.Rptr. 584, 583 P.2d 109];  Schuhart v. Pinguelo (1990) 230 Cal.App.3d 1599, 1609 [282 Cal.Rptr. 144].)   When uncertainty exists, the court must consider the consequences that will flow from a particular interpretation.  (Dyna-Med Inc. v. Fair Employment & Housing Com. (1987) 43 Cal.3d 1379, 1387 [241 Cal.Rptr. 67, 743 P.2d 1323].)   In determining legislative intent, we look to the entire statutory scheme of which the provision is a part.  (Clean Air Constituency v. California State Air Resources Board (1974) 11 Cal.3d 801, 814 [114 Cal.Rptr. 577, 523 P.2d 617].)  ‘[O]nce a particular legislative intent has been ascertained, it must be given effect even though it may not be consistent with the strict letter of the statute.’  (Kagy v. Napa State Hospital (1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 1 [33 Cal.Rptr.2d 741].)” (Downen's Inc. v. City of Hawaiian Gardens Redevelopment Agency (2001) 86 Cal.App.4th 856, 860, 103 Cal.Rptr.2d 644.)
 The mechanics' lien statutes are uniformly classified “as remedial legislation, to be liberally construed for the protection of laborers and materialmen.”  (Connolly Development, Inc. v. Superior Court (1976) 17 Cal.3d 803, 826-827, 132 Cal.Rptr. 477, 553 P.2d 637;  see also Ivy Trucking, Inc. v. Creston Brandon Corp. (2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 85, 89, 100 Cal.Rptr.2d 582.)   Generally, doubts about their meaning are resolved in favor of the contractor or laborer.  (Solit v. Tokai Bank, Ltd. (1999) 68 Cal.App.4th 1435, 1442, 81 Cal.Rptr.2d 243.)
In enacting the mechanics' lien statutes, the Legislature intended “to prevent unjust enrichment of a property owner at the expense of a laborer or material supplier.”  (Burton v. Sosinsky (1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 562, 568, 250 Cal.Rptr. 33.)   At the same time, the recordation of a mechanics' lien encumbers real property and, at least temporarily, deprives the owner of valuable property rights.  (Connolly Development Inc. v. Superior Court, supra, 17 Cal.3d at p. 827, 132 Cal.Rptr
