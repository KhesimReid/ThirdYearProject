SUMMARY
The People appeal from an order requiring Michael Bergin, as a condition of probation, to pay restitution to victim Jennifer Armstrong in the amount of $36,900.39 for medical expenses.   The People contend the restitution amount should have been $138,667.03 (the amount billed by Armstrong's medical providers) rather than $36,900.39 (the amount the medical providers accepted from Armstrong's insurer as full payment for their services, plus the deductible paid by Armstrong).   Finding no merit in the People's contention, we affirm the restitution order.
FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
Bergin was charged in a felony complaint with violations of the Vehicle Code in connection with an incident that occurred on July 16, 2004.   Bergin was turning left at the corner of Fountain Avenue and Crescent Heights Boulevard in Los Angeles, and his car struck pedestrian Jennifer Armstrong.   Armstrong suffered injuries, including a fractured left knee requiring two surgeries.   On March 10, 2005, Bergin entered a plea of nolo contendere to a charge of driving with a blood alcohol level of .08 percent or more and causing injury to another person.  (Veh.Code, § 23153, subd. (b).)  He was convicted and placed on formal probation for 36 months.   Conditions of probation included making restitution to Armstrong.
Twenty-two months later, on January 8, 2007, Armstrong filed a brief requesting restitution in the amount of $150,667.03, a sum which included $138,667.03 for medical expenses.   Meanwhile, during the time between Bergin's plea in 2005 and the restitution hearings in 2007, Armstrong brought a civil action against Bergin.   She obtained a judgment in the sum of $91,262.02.   Of that amount, $36,744.24 was for medical expenses.  (The jury awarded $129,269.53 in economic damages for medical expenses, and the trial court reduced the amount to $36,744.24.   The reduction was in accordance with Hanif v. Housing Authority (1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 635, 640, 246 Cal.Rptr. 192 (Hanif ) [an injured plaintiff may not recover from the tortfeasor more than the actual amount she paid, or for which she incurred liability, for medical services].)
A restitution hearing was held on February 9, 2007, at which the trial court expressed its tentative intention to “follow the civil judgment,” but gave the parties an opportunity to brief the point.   After hearing arguments at two further hearings, the trial court issued an order requiring Bergin to pay restitution in the sum of $36,900.39 for medical expenses.   While recognizing it could disregard the civil court judgment, the court observed:
“Why shouldn't I follow it so that we can have consistent decisions, consistent verdicts?   This case realistically we should have had a restitution hearing two years ago.  [¶] ․ [¶] So part of the problem is that everybody sat on their rights waiting on the civil court to take action [and] when that outcome wasn't satisfactory[,][i]t's coming back here.   That doesn't seem to me to be a good solution either.   So that's why it seems to me-we want Ms. Armstrong to be whole, and it seems to me she should be made whole from the standpoint of economic losses if I make the order that I'm going to make.   I don't see how she would not be 100 percent compensated.”
The People filed a timely appeal from the trial court's order.
DISCUSSION
The People contend the trial court should have set restitution in the amount billed by Armstrong's medical providers.   According to the People, the plain language of the restitution statute, as interpreted in People v. Birkett (1999) 21 Cal.4th 226, 87 Cal.Rptr.2d 205, 980 P.2d 912 (Birkett ) and further explained in People v. Hove (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 1266, 91 Cal.Rptr.2d 128 (Hove ), precludes the court from ordering “less than full restitution merely because the victim's insurer has adjusted downward the medical costs it would pay.”   But the People's argument assumes the very point at issue:  whether the court ordered “less than full restitution” when it ordered Bergin to pay Armstrong the amount her insurers actually paid for medical expenses, rather than the amount “actually incurred by Armstrong's medical providers.”   We conclude the trial court fully complied with the statute's mandate to “order full restitution” of Armstrong's “economic loss as a result of [Bergin's] conduct․” (Pen.Code, § 1202.4, subd. (f).)
 Penal Code section 1202.4 contains an express statement of the Legislature's intent:  “that a victim of crime who incurs any economic loss as a result of the commission of a crime shall receive restitution directly from any defendant convicted of that crime.” 1 (§ 1202.4, subd. (a)(1).)   The restitution order “shall be of a dollar amount that is sufficient to fully reimburse the victim or victims for every determined economic loss incurred as the result of the defendant's criminal conduct ․” (§ 1202.4, subd. (f)(3).)   Only a victim is entitled to restitution;  the victim's insurer cannot obtain restitution from a criminal defendant.  (Birkett, supra, 21 Cal.4th at p. 229, 87 Cal.Rptr.2d 205, 980 P.2d 912 [insurers do not become direct victims by reimbursing crime losses under the terms of their policies;  victim has the right to restitution based on the full amount of her losses “without regard to full or partial recoupments from other sources”].)
 In our view, the only question presented by this case is whether Armstrong “incur[red] any economic loss” for medical expenses beyond the $36,900.39 the trial court ordered Bergin to pay her.   If she did, then the trial court abused its discretion in failing to comply with the statutory mandate to fully reimburse her for economic losses.   But we can detect no basis for concluding that Armstrong incurred any other economic loss beyond that identified in the trial court's order.   The People say Bergin must pay restitution in the amount “actually incurred by Armstrong's medical providers,” but of course the statute says nothing of the sort.   Indeed, Armstrong's medical providers agreed with Blue Cross to accept the amounts Blue Cross paid on Armstrong's behalf;  neither Armstrong nor her insurer expended more than the trial court ordered to be paid to Armstrong as restitution.2
The People nonetheless insist that the trial court was required to order restitution in the amount billed by Armstrong's medical providers, even though neither Armstrong nor her insurers paid that amount.   The People rely on Hove, supra, 76 Cal.App.4th 1266, 91 Cal.Rptr.2d 128, where the court upheld a restitution order requiring the defendant to pay the victim “the full amount of the losses caused by his crime,” even though the victim had no actual economic losses, because all his medical expenses were paid by Medi-Cal or Medicare benefits.  (Id. at p. 1272, 91 Cal.Rptr.2d 128.)   Further, the trial court “used the claims billed amount ($286,565.92) rather than the total amounts which had actually been paid by the date of the computer run ($89,054.34).”  (Id. at p. 1274, 91 Cal.Rptr.2d 128.)
Hove does not assist the People.   First, Hove is merely an application of the principle stated in Birkett:  “the immediate victim of the probationer's crime was entitled to receive restitution ‘directly’ from the probationer for the full amount of the loss caused by the probationer's criminal conduct,” and “such reparation should go entirely to the individual or entity the offender had directly wronged, regardless of that victim's reimbursement from other sources.”  (Birkett, supra, 21 Cal.4th at pp. 245, 246, 87 Cal.Rptr.2d 205, 980 P.2d 912, italics omitted.)   Second, the trial court had good reasons for ordering restitution in the amount of the “claims billed,” rather than the amount actually paid by Medi-Cal or Medicare as of the date of the computer report presented to the trial court.   The victim in Hove was totally incapacitated and in a vegetative state as a result of the defendant's crime, and would always require long-ter
