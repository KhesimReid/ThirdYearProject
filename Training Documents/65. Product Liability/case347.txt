Plaintiff Cynthia Schafer Uhiren (“Uhiren”) appeals from the decision of the district court granting summary judgment in favor of defendant Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Inc. (“Bristol-Myers”) in Uhiren's product liability claims arising out of her use of Stadol Nasal Spray (“Stadol”), a prescription pain medication manufactured and distributed by Bristol-Myers.   We affirm.
I.
The substantive and procedural facts relevant to this appeal follow.   Uhiren suffered from chronic migraine headaches.   In 1994, she was under the care of Dr. Mary Corbitt, a neurologist.   Dr. Corbitt prescribed Stadol to alleviate Uhiren's pain until Dr. Corbitt discovered that Uhiren had obtained Stadol prescriptions from multiple sources without Dr. Corbitt's knowledge.   At that point, Dr. Corbitt confronted Uhiren, expressed concern about the quantity of Stadol that Uhiren was consuming, and offered to refer Uhiren to a drug rehabilitation program.   Uhiren did not enter into a rehabilitation program, and she did not return to Dr. Corbitt for further treatment.
After leaving Dr. Corbitt's care, Uhiren continued to acquire Stadol through other doctors.   Early in 1995, she obtained a Stadol prescription from Dr. Mary O'Brien by knowingly misleading Dr. O'Brien about her medical history.   Shortly thereafter, in February 1995, Uhiren sought to obtain Stadol through Dr. Steven Landry.   Uhiren testified that she did not tell Dr. Landry about her treatment by Dr. O'Brien because Uhiren believed that if she told him, Dr. Landry would not prescribe Stadol for her.   The record includes a total of seven writings from physicians, each of whom had prescribed Stadol to Uhiren without knowing that she was receiving Stadol from other sources.
In 1994, Uhiren received 366 bottles of Stadol.   The amount of Stadol she received decreased significantly in 1995 and 1996, and continued to decrease in 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2000.
In February of 1995, Dr. Steven Collier, Uhiren's nurse practitioner supervisor, spoke with Uhiren about an investigation into Uhiren's use of Stadol conducted by the Arkansas Health Department.   Dr. Collier subsequently terminated Uhiren's employment.
In July 1995, Uhiren received a notice from the Arkansas State Board of Nursing notifying her of a disciplinary hearing to determine whether to suspend her nursing license due to her use of Stadol.   The hearing took place on August 10, 1995, after which Uhiren's nursing license was suspended.
On August 13, 1998, Uhiren filed a complaint against Bristol-Myers but was granted a voluntary non-suit on June 30, 1999.   On June 29, 2000, she filed the present complaint in which she alleged that “[b]etween 1992 and 1995, as a proximate result of the use of Stadol, [Uhiren] became addicted to and dependent upon [Stadol],” and that in 1995 she “suffered pain, diarrhea, severe stomach cramps and lost her sense of smell and taste” as a result of her addiction to Stadol.   Bristol-Myers moved for summary judgment, asserting that because Uhiren had become addicted to Stadol more than three years before filing her complaint, the Arkansas statute of limitations barred her claims.
Uhiren argued that summary judgment was inappropriate because there was a genuine factual dispute as to when she became aware that she was addicted to Stadol.   On June 17, 2002, she submitted an affidavit stating that she did not believe that she was addicted until 1996 or 1997 when she suffered withdrawal symptoms.   She also noted deposition testimony of her expert psychologist, Dr. Harold J. Bursztajn.   With respect to Uhiren's awareness of her Stadol problem at the time Dr. Corbitt confronted Uhiren about her Stadol use and suggested that Uhiren enter into drug rehabilitation, Dr. Bursztajn opined that Uhiren “couldn't believe her ears at that point” because “it takes time for people to change their minds.”
The district court granted Bristol-Myers's summary judgment motion.   CV 200-000114, slip op. at 10 (E.D.Ark. August 16, 2002) (Wilson, J.).   The district court noted that the following undisputed facts showed that Uhiren was on notice of her Stadol-related drug injury more than three years before she filed her complaint:  (1) Dr. Corbitt's confrontation of Uhiren in 1994 in which Dr. Corbitt recommended that Uhiren participate in drug rehabilitation because of her Stadol consumption;  (2) Uhiren's admission that she lied to several physicians in 1994 and early 1995 in order to obtain multiple prescriptions of Stadol;  (3) Uhiren's termination from her employment as a nurse practitioner in early 1995 because of an unfavorable on-going investigation into her drug abuse by the Arkansas Health Department;  (4) testimony of Uhiren's supervisor that Uhiren did not contest his statement to her that the investigation by the Department of Health dealt with her alleged drug abuse;  and (5) the fact that Uhiren filled prescriptions for 336 bottles of Stadol in 1994.  Id. at 7-8.
With respect to Uhiren's arguments, the district court noted that although Dr. Bursztajn testified that Uhiren did not believe Dr. Corbitt in 1994 when Dr. Corbitt confronted her, another of Uhiren's experts, Dr. James Hayden, testified that Uhiren was aware of her Stadol addiction in 1994.   The court refused to allow Uhiren to use her affidavit to establish a dispute in order to defeat summary judgment.  Id. at 7.
This appeal followed.   On appeal, Uhiren asserts the following errors by the district court:  (1) failure to recognize the distinction between drug abuse and drug addiction;  (2) failure to recognize the existence of a factual dispute as to when Uhiren first became aware of her alleged injuries;  (3) rejection from consideration of the statements in Uhiren's sworn affidavit;  (4) affording improper weight to the testimony of two of Uhiren's experts and ultimately giving no weight to one;  (5) making a finding based on insufficient evidence that Uhiren's termination from employment was related to Stadol;  and (6) concluding that Uhiren's complaint was untimely filed.
II.
 We review the district court's grant of summary judgment de novo, giving the non-moving party the most favorable reading of the record as well as the benefit of any reasonable inferences that arise from the record.  Gentry v. Georgia-Pacific Corp., 250 F.3d 646, 649 (8th Cir.2001).
Summary judgment is appropriate only when the pleadings, depositions and affidavits submitted by the parties indicate no genuine issue of material fact and show that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.   Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).  The party seeking summary judgment must first identify grounds demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.   Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2553, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).   Such a showing shifts to the non-movant the burden to go beyond the pleadings and present affirmative evidence showing that a genuine issue of material fact exists.  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 256-57, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2514, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).   The non-moving party “must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.”  Matsushita Elec. Ind. Co., 475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 1356, 89 L.Ed.2d (1986).   The non-movant “must show there is sufficient evidence to support a jury verdict in [her] favor.”  Nat'l Bank of Commerce v. Dow Chem. Co., 165 F.3d 602, 607 (8th Cir.1999).  “Factual disputes that are irrelevant or unnecessary will not be counted,” Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, and a mere scintilla of evidence supporting the nonmovant's position will not fulfill the non-movant's burden, id. at 252, 106 S.Ct. 2505.
 The Arkansas statute of limitations provides that a product liability action “shall be commenced within three (3) years after the date on which the death, injury, or damage complained of occurs.”  Ark.Code Ann. § 16-116-103.   A cause of action accrues when the plaintiff “first becomes aware of her condition,
