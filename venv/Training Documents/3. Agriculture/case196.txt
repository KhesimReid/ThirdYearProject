Kim Netland brings this action against Hess & Clark, Inc. (“Hess”), the manufacturer of the pesticide KenAg Bovinol (“Bovinol”), claiming damages for injury resulting from Netland's use of Bovinol on his horses.   The district court 1 granted Hess's motion for summary judgment holding that Netland's claims are preempted by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (“FIFRA”), 7 U.S.C. § 136 et seq., because they are an impermissible challenge to Bovinol's label.   For the reasons stated below, we affirm.
I.
Netland, in the summer of 1994, following his junior year of high school, used Bovinol to control flies on his family's three horses.   Margaret Netland, Netland's mother, purchased the pesticide in June 1994, from a local retail feed store for the purpose of minimizing the risk of injury to Netland from the unpredictable behavior of horses due to the annoyance of flies.   The sales clerk informed Mrs. Netland that the pesticide would work for horses.   Prior to giving Netland the pesticide, Mrs. Netland read the warning label and wore plastic gloves to pour the pesticide into a bathroom cleaner spray bottle.   Thereafter, Netland sprayed the pesticide on his horses three to four times a week over a six-week period.   Prior to riding, Netland sprayed each horse with eight to ten squirts of the pesticide and would normally ride the horse within a minute after spraying it with the pesticide.   Netland did not wear any protective clothing or equipment when he used the pesticide and did not read the Bovinol label.   Netland believes that he got the pesticide on his skin by touching the horses because his clothes were damp after riding.
In mid-August 1994, Netland began high school football practice and began to experience fatigue and bruising.   On September 28, 1994, Netland collapsed on his way to school and was taken to his family physician, Dr. Thabes.   Realizing that Netland had a severe blood problem, Dr. Thabes transferred Netland to a hematologist in Fargo, North Dakota, where he was diagnosed with acquired aplastic anemia.2  Over the next year, Netland's treatment consisted of large doses of steroids and approximately thirty-five blood transfusions.   As a result of this treatment, one of Netland's hips failed and was replaced with a prosthesis.   Netland's other hip is also at risk.
Bovinol is a registered insecticide with the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) under FIFRA and carries an EPA-approved label.   Dichlorvos (“DDVP”), the active ingredient in Bovinol, is an organophosphate, which is absorbed into the human body by ingestion, inhalation, and skin absorption.   The Bovinol label describes the approved and lawful uses of the pesticide, including use on cattle, in animal buildings (horse barns, shelter sheds, dairy barns, milk sheds), in poultry houses, dog kennels, and outdoor uses (picnic grounds, loading docks, outdoor latrines, parking areas, refuse areas, around service stations, open-air drive-ins, outdoor ice cream stands, and garbage collection and disposal areas).   The label does not expressly state that Bovinol may be used on horses.   The Bovinol label also contains a precautionary instruction and warning.3
On July 1, 1999, Netland filed a three-count complaint against Hess alleging (1) strict liability in that Bovinol was defectively designed and unreasonably dangerous, (2) failure to warn users of the dangerous characteristics inherent in the Bovinol product, and (3) negligence and breach of warranty in that Hess failed to use reasonable care in the design, manufacture, and sale of Bovinol.   On January 19, 2001, Hess moved for summary judgment asserting federal preemption under FIFRA and also that Netland failed to offer admissible proof of causation.   Hess also filed a motion to exclude the opinion testimony of several of Netland's expert witnesses.
The district court granted Hess's motion for summary judgment without reaching the issue of causation or the admissibility of the testimony of Netland's expert witnesses.   In particular, the district court found that each of Netland's claims is essentially an attack on Bovinol's EPA-approved label, and therefore is preempted by FIFRA. Netland v. Hess & Clark, Inc., 140 F.Supp.2d 1011, 1017-19 (D.Minn.2001).   Netland timely appealed.

 A grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo.  Nat'l Bank of Commerce v. Dow Chem. Co., 165 F.3d 602, 606 (8th Cir.1999).   Summary judgment is appropriate if, after viewing the facts and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, here Netland, the record demonstrates that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Id.See also Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c);  Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).   In addition, preemption is a question of law reviewed de novo.  Nat'l Bank, 165 F.3d at 607.
A.
 Under FIFRA, all pesticides sold in the United States must be registered with the EPA. See 7 U.S.C. § 136a(a) (1994).   When applying for registration, manufacturers must submit draft label language addressing a number of topics including ingredients, directions for use, and any information of which they “are aware regarding unreasonable adverse effects of the pesticide on man or the environment.”  40 C.F.R. § 152.50(f)(3) (2001).   Prior to registering a pesticide, the EPA must find that its labeling complies with FIFRA's requirements, such as a determination that the pesticide is not misbranded, and that when the pesticide is used in accordance with its labeling that it will perform its intended function without an unreasonable adverse effect on the environment.   See 7 U.S.C. § 136a(c)(5) (1994).   Finally, FIFRA contains an express preemption clause, which provides that a state “shall not impose or continue in effect any requirements for labeling ․ in addition to or different from those required under this subchapter.”  7 U.S.C. § 136v(b) (1994).
 In National Bank, we held that once a label is approved, FIFRA expressly provides a defense, arising from preemption, against certain state law claims.  165 F.3d at 608.   Specifically, we held that FIFRA preempts state common law claims for “ ‘inadequate labeling or failure to warn.’ ”   Id. (quoting Bice v. Leslie's Poolmart, Inc., 39 F.3d 887, 888 (8th Cir.1994)).   Moreover, we stated:
It is immaterial whether an inadequate labeling or failure to warn claim is brought under a negligence or products liability theory.   If a state law claim is premised on inadequate labeling or a failure to warn, the impact of allowing the claim would be to impose an additional or different requirement for the label or packaging.
Id. (footnote omitted).   Common law claims for breach of express warranty also are preempted by FIFRA.  Id. (citing Welchert v. Am. Cyanamid, Inc., 59 F.3d 69, 73 (8th Cir.1995)).
 Netland concedes that our decision in National Bank preempts his state law claims based on labeling or packaging requirements in addition to or different from those required under FIFRA.   Nevertheless, Netland asks us to revisit our prior decisions insofar as they hold that state law claims based on failure to warn are preempted by FIFRA.   Netland maintains that a revisiting is necessitated by the Supreme Court's decision in Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U.S. 470, 116 S.Ct. 2240, 135 L.Ed.2d 700 (1996), and an amicus curiae brief submitted by the United States Department of Justice, representing the EPA, filed in Etcheverry v. Tri-Ag Serv., Inc., 22 Cal.4th 316, 93 Cal.Rptr.2d 36, 993 P.2d 366 (Cal.2000), which articulated the government's position that FIFRA does not preempt any state law theories of liability, including failure to warn claims that implicate pesticide labels.   In addition, Netland draws our attention to two recent state court decisions finding failure to warn claims not preempted in light of these recent developments.   See Sleath v.
