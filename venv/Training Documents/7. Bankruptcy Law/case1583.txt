OPINION
Appellant Adolfo Barrientos filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy and obtained a discharge of debt under 11 U.S.C. § 524. According to Appellant's complaint, however, certain credit reporting agencies continued to report Appellant's previous debt to Appellee Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. When Appellant disputed the debt, one or more of the agencies contacted Appellee, who allegedly verified a debt of $80,831 in violation of § 524.
Appellant filed an adversary complaint on April 27, 2007. The First Amended Adversary Complaint (“FAAC”) contained a single cause of action for contempt for violation of § 524, seeking an injunction, a “coercive fine,” declaratory relief, and attorney's fees. Appellee filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), which the bankruptcy court granted on January 31, 2008, ruling that under Walls v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 276 F.3d 502, 506-07 (9th Cir.2002), § 105 creates no private right of action to sue for a violation of § 524. The district court affirmed on May 27, 2009 under Walls, and noted that Appellant's remedy was to seek a contempt order directly in the bankruptcy court.
Appellant timely appealed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U .S.C. § 1291. We affirm. A motion for contempt for violation of a discharge injunction under § 524 must be brought via motion in the bankruptcy case, not via an adversary proceeding.
I. Standard of Review
We review a district court's decision on an appeal from a bankruptcy court de novo, with no deference given to the district court's decision. See Barclay v. McKenzie (In re AFI Holding, Inc.), 525 F.3d 700, 702 (9th Cir.2008). A bankruptcy court's decision to dismiss an action for failure to state a claim is reviewed de novo, see Zimmer v. PSB Lending Corp. (In re Zimmer), 313 F.3d 1220, 1222 (9th Cir.2002), as is its interpretation of the bankruptcy code, see Blausey v. U.S. Tr., 552 F.3d 1124, 1132 (9th Cir.2009).
II. Procedure to Seek an Order of Contempt for a Violation of § 524
A. The Civil Contempt Power of the Bankruptcy Court
Prior to the Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of 1984, bankruptcy judges had implied power to hold litigants in civil contempt just as Article III judges have. 2 Collier on Bankruptcy ¶ 105.02[1][b] (Alan N. Resnick & Henry J. Sommer eds., 16th ed.2009). Since 1984, however, the civil contempt power of bankruptcy judges has been based on § 105 of the Bankruptcy Code. Id.; see 11 U.S.C. § 105.
B. There is No Private Right of Action for a Discharge Violation
We have previously ruled after significant discussion that the availability of contempt proceedings under § 105 for violation of a discharge injunction under § 524 does not create a private right of action for damages. See Walls, 276 F.3d at 507-10 (affirming a district court's dismissal of a claim under § 524 brought in the district court). We noted that the remedy of contempt was available directly in the core bankruptcy proceedings:
Implying a private remedy here could put enforcement of the discharge injunction in the hands of a court that did not issue it (perhaps even in the hands of a jury), which is inconsistent with the present scheme that leaves enforcement to the bankruptcy judge whose discharge order gave rise to the injunction. This makes a good deal of sense, given that the equities at issue are bankruptcy equities, and it would undermine Congress's deliberate decision to place supervision of discharge in the bankruptcy court:
Since 1898, in all but extraordinary situations the effect of a discharge had been a matter which would be determined only in a state court or, where there was some ground of jurisdiction other than the involvement of the discharge, in a federal court. Congress became convinced that relegating a discharged bankrupt to other courts for vindication of his discharge resulted so often in the loss of its intended benefit and frustration of the objective of the federal legislation that jurisdiction of determining the effect of a discharge was given to the bankruptcy court.
Id. at 509-10(quoting Report of the Commission on the Bankruptcy Laws of the United States, H.R. Doc. No. 137, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. (1973), quoted in H.R.Rep. No. 95-595 at 46-47 (1978), reprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5963, 6008).
Appellant argues that although we held in Walls that there is no private right of action for damages under § 524, we did not hold that adversary proceedings under Bankruptcy Rule 7001 were therefore necessarily unavailable as a vehicle to enforce § 524. None of the cases cited by the parties addresses this question in so many words, but our holding in Walls supports such a conclusion. Specifically, we reasoned that Congress did not intend for enforcement of a discharge order to be left to any other judge than the bankruptcy judge who issued the order, see id., which would be a possible result if an adversary proceeding were available to pursue contempt for violation of a discharge order. We therefore rule that Walls is sufficient to dispose of the present case. However, even in the absence of Walls, it appears that the Bankruptcy Rules require that an action for contempt arising out of the violation of an order issued in a bankruptcy case must be brought by motion in the bankruptcy case.
C. Contested Matters Versus Adversary Proceedings
Bankruptcy Rule 9020 provides that Bankruptcy Rule 9014 governs contempt proceedings in bankruptcy. Fed. R. Bankr.P. 9020(“Rule 9014 governs a motion for an order of contempt made by the United States trustee or a party in interest.”). Bankruptcy Rule 9014 in turn is the rule that governs contested matters. See Fed. R. Bankr.P. 9014(a). In other words, a contempt proceeding by the United States trustee or a party in interest in bankruptcy is a contested matter. (Id.; Fed. R. Bankr.P. 9020; see 10 Collier on Bankruptcy ¶ 9020.02 (Alan N. Resnick & Henry J. Sommer eds., 15th ed. rev.2007)). Bankruptcy Rule 9014 adopts many procedures from Part VII of the Bankruptcy Rules (which governs adversary proceedings), but not all such procedures. See Fed. R. Bankr.P. 9014(c).
“Contested matter” in the bankruptcy context is a term of art. There is a distinction among “contested matters,” “adversary proceedings,” and “administrative matters.” See 10 Collier on Bankruptcy ¶ 9014.01(Alan N. Resnick & Henry J. Sommer eds., 15th ed. rev.2007). Administrative matters are those issues that are not contested, such as unopposed motions. Id. Adversary proceedings are a species of contested matters governed by Part VII of the Bankruptcy Rules. Id. A matter qualifies as an “adversary proceeding,” as opposed to a “contested matter,” if it is included in the list given in Bankruptcy Rule 7001. Id.; see Fed. R. Bankr.P. 7001. Otherwise, it is a “contested matter .” See Fed. R. Bankr.P. 9014(a). Contempt proceedings are not listed under Bankruptcy Rule 7001, see Fed. R. Bankr.P. 7001, and are therefore contested matters not qualifying as adversary proceedings. At oral argument, Appellant argued that because Bankruptcy Rule 9014 invokes certain rules utilized for adversary proceedings under Part VII of the Bankruptcy Rules, any motion brought pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 9014 could also impliedly be brought as an adversary proceeding. Such a construction does not follow, and if adopted it would obliterate the difference between contested matters and adversary proceedings, obviating the list under Rule 7001, because under this construction any contested matter under Bankruptcy Rule 9014 could necessarily be brought as an adversary proceeding under Rule 7001.
Appellant argues that contempt proceedings seeking to enforce injunctions are impliedly included under subsection (7) of Rule 7001, which includes “proceeding[s] to obtain an injunction or other equitable relief, except when a chapter 9, chapter 11, chapter 12, or chapter 13 plan provides for the relief.” Fed. R. Bankr.P. 7001(7). A plain reading of Bankruptcy Rule 9020 compels the contrary conclusion, however, that contempt proceedings brought by the trustee or a party in interest are contested matters that must be brought by motio
