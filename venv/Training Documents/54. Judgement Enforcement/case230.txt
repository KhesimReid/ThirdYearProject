I. OVERVIEW
This appeal is from the district court's denial of a Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion for relief from judgment filed by Plaintiffs Big Top Koolers, Inc. and Nicholas C. Brienza (collectively “Big Top”).   The motion asserts that Big Top's counsel did not receive notice of a final order entered by the court, and thus did not timely ask for rehearing or file a notice of appeal.   We find no reversible error in denial of the motion for two reasons.   First, the time for filing notice of appeal had not expired.   And, second, Rule 60(b) no longer provides a basis to extend the time to file a notice of appeal because of failure to receive notice of the final judgment.   We affirm.
II. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY
Big Top filed this breach of contract action against Defendant Circus-Man Snacks, Inc. (“Circus-Man”) involving an ice cream distributorship.   After a jury trial, the district court entered an Order of Remittitur, remitting the $493,750 verdict to $15,850.   In this order, entered on May 25, 2004, the court required Big Top to elect whether to accept this remitted amount or demand a new trial on damages within ten days of the order.   The court explained “that Plaintiffs must consent to this remittitur in order for it to be valid.   In the absence of Plaintiffs' consent, the court will have no alternative but to order a new trial.”  (R.3-139 at 5.)
On June 10, 2004, Big Top filed a motion for rehearing on the remittitur, objecting to the order of remittitur, and requesting a higher remitted amount of damages or, in the alternative, a new trial.   Big Top filed an amended motion for rehearing on the remittitur on June 15, 2004, which requested a higher amount of damages.   On November 12, 2004, the district court denied both Big Top's motion and its amended motion for rehearing.
In early September 2004, Hurricane Frances, a Category 3 hurricane, struck Saint Lucie and Martin County, Florida.   About three weeks later, Hurricane Jeanne, another Category 3 storm, came ashore in the same area.   According to John J. Anastasio, counsel for Big Top, Jeanne destroyed his office and forced the evacuation of his home.   The damage caused by these hurricanes may partially explain the inactivity in this case from late 2004 through early 2006.
On March 9, 2006-the next docket entry after the district court's November 12, 2004 order denying Big Top's motions for rehearing-Anastasio filed a change of address notice with the district court clerk.   Also on March 9, 2006, Big Top filed a motion seeking a scheduling order and an order setting the case for a trial on damages, stating that “[t]he defendant [sic] responded that it did not accept the court's remitteter [sic] and requested a new trial on damages.”  (R.4-155 at 1.)
On May 10, 2006, the district court denied Big Top's motion seeking a scheduling order and a trial setting.   The court reasoned that Big Top had “impliedly opted” to accept the remittitur in the first place since it did not timely advise the court that it wanted a new trial or file a notice of appeal.   The court reasoned that Big Top had “waived a right to a retrial of this case.”  (R.4-156 at 2-3.)   The order then said:  “ORDERED and ADJUDGED that Plaintiff's Motion for Scheduling Order and to Set Trial is DENIED.   The previously entered Order of Remittitur stands as the final order of this court.   The Clerk of the Court shall close this case for lack of timely prosecution on the part of the Plaintiff.”  (R.4-156 at 3.)
Anastasio says that he never received notice of this order, allegedly because the district court clerk did not change his address as requested.1  He asserts that he became aware of the order in September 2006.2  At this point, Big Top filed a motion for relief from judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(a)3 and (b)(1)4 on September 25, 2006.   (R.4-158.)   In this motion, Big Top sought “to have the order reentered to allow for timely rehearing and appellate remedies,” since it did not receive notice of the May 10, 2006 order.  (R. 4-158 at 3.)   The district court denied Big Top's motion on October 24, 2006.  (R.4-162.)   The court's rationale was similar to that in its May 10, 2006 order, and the court said that the motion was untimely and without merit.   The court inexplicably ignored Big Top's contention that it never received notice of the court's May 10, 2006 order.
On November 22, 2006, Big Top filed a notice of appeal.   The focus of Big Top's appeal is on the denial of relief under Rule 60(b)-not Rule 60(a).   Specifically, Big Top challenges (1) the November 12, 2004 order denying its motion for rehearing on the remittitur order;  (2) the May 10,5 2006 order denying Big Top's motion for a scheduling order and a trial setting;  and (3) the district court's October 24, 2006 order denying its Rule 60(b) motion.   A motions panel of this court dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction Big Top's appeal as to the November 12, 2004 and May 10, 2006 orders, because Big Top had not filed a timely notice of appeal.6  The court allowed this appeal to proceed only as to the district court's October 24, 2006 order denying Big Top's Rule 60(b) motion.
III. STANDARD OF REVIEW
 We review a district court's denial of a Rule 60(b) motion for an abuse of discretion.   See Turner v. Sec'y of the Air Force, 944 F.2d 804, 807 (11th Cir.1991);  Jackson v. People's Republic of China, 794 F.2d 1490, 1494 (11th Cir.1986).
IV. CONTENTIONS OF THE PARTIES
Big Top argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying its Rule 60(b) motion because the court (1) did not consider the basis for the motion;  (2) failed to consider appropriate factors in exercising its discretion;  (3) failed to consider the equities;  and (4) based its denial of the motion on factual errors.
Circus-Man contends that the district court did not abuse its discretion because Big Top's counsel repeatedly delayed and was not diligent in tracking the status of the case.   Circus-Man also argues that Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6) provides the only means of extending the time for an appeal based on failure to receive notice.   Finally, Circus-Man contends that the May 10, 2006 order was not an order that Big Top was entitled to have the district court set aside.
V. DISCUSSION
 This appeal from denial of Rule 60(b) relief is timely.   Notice of appeal was filed within thirty days of the denial of the motion.   We must, however, determine when a final judgment was entered that started the thirty-day appeal clock.   The parties disagree about this, and we disagree with both parties.
Circus-Man contends that the November 12, 2004 order was a final judgment, and that the time to appeal ran from this date.   We reject this argument.   This order simply denied Big Top's motion seeking a rehearing as to the remittitur order, and did nothing more.  (R.4-150.)
Big Top contends that the order of May 10, 2006 (which its counsel asserts he did not receive) was a final judgment.   We agree that this was a final judgment.   This order, as previously noted, said that Big Top had “impliedly opted” to accept the remittitur, and directed the clerk to close the file.   Concluding that this May 10, 2006 order was a final judgment, however, does not end our inquiry;  we must decide when it was entered.
Big Top complains, both in its Rule 60(b) motion and on this appeal, that the district court did not properly enter final judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 58:  “Every judgment and amended judgment must be set out in a separate document ․”  “[C]ases from both the Supreme Court and the circuit courts of appeal make it clear that the time to file a notice of appeal does not begin to run until a separate judgment is entered pursuant to Rule 58.”  Reynolds v. Golden Corral Corp., 213 F.3d 1344, 1346 (11th Cir.2000).   The record supports Big Top's contention that the district court failed to enter a separate document announcing final judgment under Rule 58, as the docket sheet does not reflect entry of a s
