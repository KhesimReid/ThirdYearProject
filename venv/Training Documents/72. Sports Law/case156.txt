The issue is whether the University of Massachusetts at Lowell (“the University”) waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity by expressly agreeing to federal jurisdiction in a patent license agreement.   The district court so held.1  On interlocutory review, we affirm the district court's judgment.
BACKGROUND
Charles S. Baum is the inventor of the two United States Patents in suit, concerning a device for testing baseball bats of varying construction.   On December 24, 1998 the University executed a “Confidential License Agreement” with Mr. Baum and The Baum Research and Development Corporation (collectively “Baum”).   The agreement includes the following provision:
III-3. Governing Law. This Agreement will be construed, interpreted and applied according to the laws of the State of Michigan and all parties agree to proper venue and hereby submit to jurisdiction in the appropriate State or Federal Courts of Record sitting in the State of Michigan.
The contract was executed for the University as:

Dispute arose between Baum and the University, and on September 19, 2002 Baum filed suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan, charging the University with breach of contract and patent infringement.   The University asserted immunity from suit based on the Eleventh Amendment.2  The district court denied the University's motion to dismiss on this ground, ruling that any immunity was waived by contract provision III-3. The court then bifurcated the contract and infringement claims, and held a jury trial on the breach of contract claim.   The verdict was in favor of Baum. On post-trial motion the University renewed its claim of immunity;  the district court again denied the motion, with opinion explaining that the University's Eleventh Amendment immunity was waived by the contract's explicit provision wherein all parties agreed to “submit to jurisdiction” of the appropriate federal or state court sitting in Michigan.   The district court stayed further proceedings, including its grant of a new trial on the issue of damages, pending this appeal.   Although Baum complains that the University should have appealed the Eleventh Amendment issue before the breach of contract case was tried, and should not have been permitted to reargue this issue after the trial, we discern no flaw in the district court's action in reconsidering this issue after the trial.
 The issue of Eleventh Amendment immunity is subject to collateral appellate review, and such review was accepted by this court.   See Puerto Rico Aqueduct & Sewer Auth. v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 506 U.S. 139, 147, 113 S.Ct. 684, 121 L.Ed.2d 605 (1993) (“We hold that States and state entities that claim to be ‘arms of the State’ may take advantage of the collateral order doctrine to appeal a district court order denying a claim of Eleventh Amendment immunity.”)
DISCUSSION
I
 The Eleventh Amendment limits the judicial authority of the federal courts and bars unconsented suit against a state in federal court.   See Idaho v. Coeur d'Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U.S. 261, 268, 117 S.Ct. 2028, 138 L.Ed.2d 438 (1997) (a state cannot be sued in federal court without its consent);  Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 54, 116 S.Ct. 1114, 134 L.Ed.2d 252 (1996) (same).   The University claimed immunity as an arm of the state, and Baum does not dispute that status as a state entity was created by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 75, § 1 (“The state university shall be the University of Massachusetts ․ a public institution of higher learning within the system of public higher education․”).  We give plenary review to questions of Eleventh Amendment immunity.  McKesson Corp. v. Div. of Alcoholic Beverages & Tobacco, Dep't of Bus. Regulation of Florida, 496 U.S. 18, 30, 110 S.Ct. 2238, 110 L.Ed.2d 17 (1990);  Martin v. Hunter's Lessee, 14 U.S. (1 Wheat.) 304, 348, 4 L.Ed. 97 (1816);  Vas-Cath, Inc. v. Curators of University of Missouri, 473 F.3d 1376, 1380 (Fed.Cir.2007).

 The district court held that immunity as to this contract was expressly waived by specific provision of the contract.   In College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Education Expense Bd., 527 U.S. 666, 119 S.Ct. 2219, 144 L.Ed.2d 605 (1999) the Court had reaffirmed that a state waives its immunity when it clearly declares its intention to submit to federal jurisdiction, id. at 675-76, 119 S.Ct. 2219, but the intention must be “unequivocally expressed.”  Id. at 676, 119 S.Ct. 2219 (quoting Pennhurst State School & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 99, 104 S.Ct. 900, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984)).   General consent provisions standing alone, such as general sue-and-be-sued clauses, have been held insufficient to waive Eleventh Amendment immunity, Port Auth. Trans-Hudson Corp. v. Feeney, 495 U.S. 299, 306, 110 S.Ct. 1868, 109 L.Ed.2d 264 (1990), and in Port Authority the specific authorization of suit in federal court was held to bridge that gap.  Id. at 308, 110 S.Ct. 1868.
The University argues that contract provision III-3 is in “vague language” and is not the “unequivocally expressed” consent to suit that precedent requires.   The University argues that contract provision III-3 can be read not as a waiver of immunity from suit, but merely an acceptance of venue in Michigan, if Baum can somehow overcome the obstacle of the University's immunity.   The University argues that since contract provision III-1 (Government Restrictions and Force Majeure) makes the contract “subject to all laws,” this of course includes the Constitution and its amendments, whereby provision III-3 cannot override the Constitution.   Thus the University argues that the contract itself precludes any waiver of any constitutional immunity, or at least is sufficiently ambiguous to render the asserted waiver clause void.
The district court, hearing the University's arguments both before and after trial, and carefully exploring the contract's terms in light of precedent, ruled that “by agreeing to this provision [III-3], Defendant affirmatively agreed to resolve in federal court any disputes that may arise.”   The court considered the University's arguments that the contract is ambiguous, and did not agree.   We agree with the district court that the contract terms are clear, and that the University agreed to submit to the jurisdiction of a federal court in Michigan as to disputes arising from this contract.   Although the University argues that the contract does not state which court is “appropriate” as to which cause of action as may arise, this does not negate the agreement to submit to the jurisdiction of the appropriate court.
The district court explained that the contract meets the waiver criteria of College Savings Bank and other precedent.   The district court pointed out that College Savings Bank held that a State's express waiver of sovereign immunity must be unequivocal and such immunity cannot be impliedly or constructively waived.  527 U.S. at 676-77, 119 S.Ct. 2219.   In Port Authority the Court held that New York and New Jersey waived immunity from suit by providing that consent to suit “is granted on the condition that venue ․ shall be laid within a ․ judicial district, established ․ by the United States, and situated wholly or partially within the Port of New York District”;  the Court held that this was “persuasive textual evidence that the consent to suit provision encompasses suits in federal court.”  495 U.S. at 308, 110 S.Ct. 1868.
We affirm the district court's ruling that the contract between Baum and the University is not ambiguous as to the mutual obligation to submit to jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in Michigan, and that the University thereby waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity.
