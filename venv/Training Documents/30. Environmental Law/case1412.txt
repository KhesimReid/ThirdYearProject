Appellants are the North Carolina Fisheries Association, Inc., two commercial fishermen, and a fish-packing plant (collectively, the “Association”).   They filed a complaint (petition for review) in district court against the Department of Commerce, claiming that Amendment 13C to the Fishery Management Plan for South Atlantic Snapper Grouper violated the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (the “Act”).1  The district court granted in part and denied in part the Association's motion for summary judgment.   The court held that the Department had not complied with its statutory obligation to promulgate a rebuilding plan for certain fish species following a determination that such species were “overfished,” which failure the Government had conceded.   The court then ordered that the parties confer on an appropriate remedy and submit a joint proposal or, should disagreement persist, separate proposals.   Because the parties were unable to reach agreement, the district court adopted the Government's proposal with slight adjustments to the suggested timetable.   This appeal resulted. We conclude that we lack jurisdiction and, therefore, dismiss the appeal.

America's fisheries are regulated by the Department of Commerce via the National Marine Fisheries Service.   Pursuant to the Act, the Service appoints regional fishery management councils composed of representatives of both commercial and recreational fishermen.   These councils are empowered to submit to the Service “fishery management plans” (and any necessary amendments thereto) for fisheries under their authority requiring conservation and management.2  Under the Act, any plan prepared by a Council must contain measures “necessary and appropriate ․ to prevent overfishing and rebuild overfished stocks” and must take into account, inter alia, the technical and biological characteristics of the affected fishery as well as the distributive effects of the plan on fishing communities and other parties interested in the fishery.   Plans, however, do not themselves have any regulatory effect-implementing regulations must also be enacted in order to effectuate them.   Plans and implementing regulations are both subject to public notice and comment rulemaking prior to approval by the Service.   The Act provides for judicial review, implicitly in federal district court and only to the extent authorized by the Administrative Procedure Act, of regulations promulgated by the Service or actions taken thereunder for the implementation of a fishery management plan.
Amendment 13C,3 an amendment to the Fishery Management Plan for South Atlantic Snapper Grouper, was prepared by the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council in order to end overfishing of black sea bass, snowy grouper, vermilion snapper, and golden tilefish and to permit limited increases in the commercial and recreational harvest of red porgy, off the coast of the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida.   The Council, however, neglected to include a rebuilding plan for black sea bass and snowy grouper, despite the Service's prior conclusion that these species were not only subject to overfishing but also already overfished.   Notwithstanding, the Service approved Amendment 13C and implementing regulations thereunder on August 14, 2006, imposing a variety of commercial quotas, trip limits, gear restrictions, and recreational bag limits.
The Association, whose members depend upon grouper and bass for their livelihood, along with the State of North Carolina as amicus curiae, challenged Amendment 13C and its implementing regulations on the ground that the Service had violated the Act by failing to comply with the national standards for fishery conservation and management set forth by Congress in the Act. Specifically, the Association charged that the Service had not made use of “the best scientific information available” in developing Amendment 13C and that it had neither made a fair distribution of economic burdens nor minimized the negative economic effects of the plan, in violation of §§ 1851(a)(2), (4), (5), (6), and (8) of the Act. It was alleged, moreover, that because the Service had previously made a determination that populations of snowy grouper and black sea bass were “overfished,” the Act required that Amendment 13C also include a rebuilding plan for these fisheries.   Finally, the Association claimed that the Service had violated the Regulatory Flexibility Act 4 in promulgating the plan amendment without adequate consideration of its effect on small businessmen.   The Association sought vacation of Amendment 13C and its implementing regulations.
The district court rejected most of the Association's grievances in a thorough memorandum opinion, concluding that the Service had acted reasonably in its discretionary balancing of the various interests implicated.  N.C. Fisheries Ass'n v. Gutierrez, 518 F.Supp.2d 62, 95 (D.D.C.2007) (“N.C. Fisheries I ”).   The Service conceded the validity of the Association's remaining claim that, consistent with the Act, Amendment 13C must include rebuilding plans for the replenishment of the overfished snowy grouper and black sea bass stocks and not merely restrictions designed to end the overfishing of these species.   Accordingly, the court held that Amendment 13C was unlawful.  Id. at 101.
The district court, relying on our precedent, see, e.g., Sugar Cane Growers Coop. of Fla. v. Veneman, 289 F.3d 89, 98 (D.C.Cir.2002), declined to vacate Amendment 13C, as the Association had requested, because it would be “highly disruptive.”  N.C. Fisheries I, 518 F.Supp.2d at 104.   But the judge, apparently concerned about the delay inherent in the Service's rulemaking process-despite there having been no allegation of unreasonable delay-did not merely remand to the Service.   Instead, he ordered the parties to confer on an appropriate remedy or else to submit separate remedial proposals.  Id. at 104-05.
Discussions between the parties did not yield agreement, and separate proposals were proffered.   By the time of the remedial negotiations between the parties, the Service had already drafted Amendment 15, an omnibus amendment to the fishery management plan containing, inter alia, rebuilding plans for the snowy grouper and black sea bass fisheries, and the existence of the amendment was apparently made known to the district court.   The court approved the Service's remedial proposal, which called for the removal of the rebuilding provisions for snowy grouper and black sea bass from Amendment 15 and their placement into a separate Amendment 15A, where the provisions could proceed through the administrative process in a more expeditious manner.  N.C. Fisheries Ass'n v. Gutierrez, 518 F.Supp.2d 105, 106 (D.D.C.2007) (“N.C. Fisheries II”).   After insisting on a shortening of the proposed administrative calendar, the court deemed this proposal to be an appropriate remedy and remanded to the Service.  Id.
The Association, objecting to the Service's proposal, had urged the court to require the inclusion of certain management measures and requested interim reinstatement of quota levels in effect for the first year of Amendment 13C. The court recognized, however, that the Association's preferred remedy would essentially require relitigation of the very same issues decided by the district court in its first opinion.  Id. at 107.   The court noted, moreover, that the Association would “have an opportunity to air [its] displeasure during the public comment period” for Amendment 15A. Id.
The Service ultimately approved Amendment 15A on March 14, 2008 after an administrative process that, we are told, included consideration of written comments and public hearings.   Yet, for reasons that were not explained by the Service, implementing regulations were not promulgated.  (Paradoxically, due to the fact that this appeal was taken from the district court's remand order prior to issuance of the relevant amendments, the record before us includes neither Amendment 15A nor for that matter Amendment
