A jury convicted Hector Cardona–Vicente (“Cardona”) of two counts of possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute and one count of possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime. On appeal, Cardona argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence obtained from him after a police officer, during the course of a traffic stop, conducted a pat-frisk of a fanny pack that Cardona was wearing, which contained a Glock pistol, ammunition, drugs, and cash. Upholding the district court's finding that the facts were sufficient to give rise to a reasonable suspicion that Cardona was armed and dangerous at the time of the pat-frisk, we affirm.

“In reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress, ‘[w]e recount the relevant facts as the trial court found them, consistent with record support,’ “ United States v. Romain, 393 F.3d 63, 66 (1st Cir.2004) (alteration in original) (quoting United States v. Lee, 317 F.3d 26, 30 (1st Cir.2003)), and “[w]e view the facts in the light most favorable to the district court's ruling,” United States v. Soares, 521 F.3d 117, 118 (1st Cir.2008) (quoting United States v. Kimball, 25 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1994)).
On May 17, 2013, Officer Melvin Martínez, a fifteen-year veteran of the Puerto Rico Police Department, was on motorcycle patrol in Caguas, Puerto Rico. While meeting up with another police officer in front of the Plaza del Carmen shopping center, Martínez saw that the driver of a nearby black Jeep Cherokee was not wearing a seatbelt, a violation of Puerto Rico law. Martínez and his fellow officer followed the Jeep and initiated a traffic stop. Inside were the driver, Cardona in the front passenger seat, and a minor in the back seat.
Martínez obtained the vehicle's registration from the driver, who told Martínez that he did not have his driver's license. Martínez then went around the back of the Jeep to check its registration sticker, known as a “marbete” and located at the front of the vehicle, which he did “in a tactical manner so that the occupants of [the] vehicle would not have a good visibility regarding as to where [he] was.”
As he rounded the Jeep, Martínez saw Cardona in the passenger seat grabbing a fanny pack wrapped around Cardona's waist in such a way that, based on Martínez's experience, led him to believe that there was a gun in the fanny pack. Cardona appeared to him to be nervous. Martínez then asked Cardona if he had a license to carry a firearm. According to Martínez, Cardona “gestured to [him] that he did not.” This testimony was supported by the driver of the Jeep. According to Special Agent Gabriel Ortiz of Homeland Security Investigations—who later interviewed both Cardona and the driver, and testified during the suppression hearing—the driver told him that Cardona “remained silent and looked down and acknowledged non-verbally that he did not [have a license to carry a firearm].”
Martínez, who was fearful for his life at this point, told Cardona to get out of the vehicle. Martínez opened the Jeep's door “in a tactical manner” to prevent Cardona from fleeing. After Cardona stepped out of the vehicle, Martínez touched the fanny pack and felt a gun.
Martínez said to Cardona, “you have a weapon there,” to which Cardona responded, “yes.” Martínez then “verified” that there was a firearm in the fanny pack; the driver told Ortiz that Cardona unzipped the fanny pack to reveal the weapon. At that point, Martínez read Cardona his rights and placed him under arrest.
The fanny pack contained a .40 caliber Glock pistol with one round of ammunition in the chamber, eleven additional rounds in the magazine, $597 in cash, and fourteen baggies of cocaine. After Martínez confirmed that there was a gun in the fanny pack, he asked Cardona if there was anything else illegal in the car. Cardona told him there were more items under the rear seat of the vehicle. Martínez's fellow officer looked under the seat and found a cigar box with marijuana cigars and twenty-two baggies of marijuana.
Cardona was then taken to the Caguas police precinct. Martínez read Cardona his rights, in Spanish, and also gave them to him in writing. Cardona signed the statement of rights and indicated on the form that he understood his rights and that he wished to give a statement. He then gave a written statement in which he said, in Spanish, “what they took, well, is mine.” Later, another officer again read Cardona his rights and provided them to him in Spanish. After acknowledging that he understood his rights, Cardona signed a waiver of rights. Cardona was then interviewed by Ortiz.

On May 29, 2013, Cardona was indicted on two counts of possession of a controlled substance (cocaine and marijuana) with intent to distribute, 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1), and one count of possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, 18 U.S.C. § 924(c). The indictment also included a firearms and ammunition forfeiture allegation. 18 U.S.C. § 924(d)(1); 28 U.S.C. § 2461(c).
On September 16, 2013, Cardona filed a motion to suppress all materials seized from him by the police as well as statements he made to the police “as fruit of the traffic stop, illegal search, and seizure.” Cardona argued that “[b]ased on the totality of the circumstances known to [the Puerto Rico Police Department] at [the time of the traffic stop] they had no basis to suspect an ongoing criminal activity,” that Martínez was operating on a mere “hunch,” and that Cardona's detention consequently did “not fall within the reasonable investigatory stop of Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968).”
A suppression hearing was held before a magistrate judge on November 14, 2013. Both Martínez and Ortiz testified at the hearing, and the government submitted seven documents into evidence without objection. Cardona did not take the stand or submit any evidence in support of his motion. In a Report and Recommendation issued on November 18, 2013, the magistrate judge recommended denial of Cardona's motion, concluding that “under the totality of the circumstances, there was reasonable suspicion to stop the vehicle in which defendant Cardona was an occupant,” that Cardona's warrantless arrest was based on probable cause, that the subsequent search of the car was legal, and that Cardona's statements were admissible.
Cardona filed an objection to the magistrate judge's Report and Recommendation on December 23, 2013, arguing, inter alia, that an officer's “speculation resulting from the way a person holds a fanny pack is insufficient” to justify a search. The government opposed Cardona's objection.
On February 26, 2014, the district court adopted the magistrate judge's Report and Recommendation and denied Cardona's motion to suppress. United States v. Cardona–Vicente, No. 13–cr–308, 2014 WL 794591 (D.P.R. Feb.26, 2014). Though the magistrate judge had not done so, the district court engaged in an independent Fourth Amendment analysis of the pat-frisk of the fanny pack. Id. at *1–2. The court recognized that a pat-frisk must be supported by “reasonable suspicion that the person subjected to the frisk is armed and dangerous,” id. at *1 (quoting Arizona v. Johnson, 555 U.S. 323, 327, 129 S.Ct. 781, 172 L.Ed.2d 694 (2009)), and it explained that “there [were] at least three factors here alerting Agent Martinez: (1) Cardona's nervousness, (2) the type of fanny pack around Cardona's waist, (3) the manner in which Cardona grabbed the fanny pack,” id. at *2. The court concluded that these factors “were sufficient to give Agent Martinez reasonable suspicion that Cardona was armed and dangerous,” and that once the pat-frisk was conducted, “the arrest was justified.” Id.
After plea bargaining broke down, a two-day jury trial was held on July 15 and 16, 2014. Cardona was convicted on all three counts and sentenced to a total of sixty months of imprisonment. This appeal followed.
