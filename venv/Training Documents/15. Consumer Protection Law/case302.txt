OPINION
Earle E. Ausherman and other individual consumers (“Plaintiffs”) brought this action, alleging that Banc of America Auto Finance Corporation (“BAAF”), willfully or negligently violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq. (2000) (the “Act” or “FCRA”), and the analogous Maryland Consumer Credit Reporting Agencies Act, Md.Code Ann., Com. Law § 14-1201 et seq. (2000).  Because Plaintiffs presented no evidence that BAAF acted willfully or negligently, we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment to BAAF.
I.
Plaintiffs are a number of unrelated individuals, whose credit reports between November 1999 and July 2000 list “Banc of America Auto” among the “companies [that] have received” their reports.   None of the Plaintiffs had a relationship with BAAF during this time frame that would have justified or explained a BAAF credit inquiry.
BAAF itself is not a consumer reporting agency.   Rather, BAAF is a customer-subscriber of a consumer reporting agency, Trans Union Corporation, which issued the credit reports in question in this case.   Trans Union assigns code numbers and passwords to its subscribers, who use them to access Trans Union's consumer credit report data base.   During the relevant time period, one of the codes that Trans Union assigned to BAAF was Code 1702F0000292 (“the Code”).   Trans Union bills its customers by subscriber code, and invoices generated by Trans Union between November 1999 and July 2000 show that Trans Union billed the Code to BAAF for accessing Plaintiffs' credit reports.
BAAF maintains that it did not authorize the acquisition of Plaintiffs' credit reports.   It asserts that Trans Union initially issued the Code to Oxford Resources Corporation of Melville, N.Y., a company that merged into BAAF in 1998.   E-mail correspondence among BAAF employees in the Spring of 1999 shows that some employees questioned the Code's continued validity and suggested its deactivation, but an employee from BAAF's Melville office responded that her office still needed to use the Code until that office switched to a new integrated system.
According to BAAF, its Melville office moved from the old Oxford credit review system to the new integrated BAAF system “some time in September 1999.”   The new system employed different subscriber codes for each of the credit reporting agencies (including Trans Union) and use of the Code was supposed to be discontinued after an “allowance of a period of time for existing applications to complete the underwriting process in the old system.”   Nonetheless, additional e-mail correspondence reveals that BAAF employees discovered in May 2000 that Trans Union had been and was continuing to generate invoices in connection with the Code. After confirming that no legitimate use of the Code existed, BAAF instructed Trans Union to deactivate the Code in July 2000.
Seven months later, in February 2001, Plaintiffs filed this action against BAAF, seeking compensatory damages for “dissemination of personal financial information;  invasion of privacy;  and impairment of their ability to obtain credit,” as well as punitive damages, costs, and legal fees.1  Plaintiffs allege that because BAAF or one of its employees “knowingly[,] willfully and intentionally” obtained Plaintiffs' consumer reports without an authorized purpose, BAAF is liable to them for actual and punitive damages under 15 U.S.C. § 1681n and Md.Code Ann., Com. Law § 14-1213(a).   Alternatively, Plaintiffs allege that BAAF negligently breached a duty owed to them to implement and maintain procedures to prevent violations of the Act and hence is liable for actual damages under 15 U.S.C. § 1681o and Md.Code Ann., Com. Law § 14-1213(b).
After Plaintiffs filed suit, BAAF conducted a variety of tests, including a forensic examination, all of which purportedly indicate that the Code was not used on the new system or on the computers in the Melville office.   One of BAAF's experts opined that, based on his review of 277 hard drives in the Melville office, a forensic examination conducted by BAAF on these computers “would have to a reasonable degree of certainty identified instances” of uses of the Code on the target computers.   BAAF also presented the affidavit of Trans Union's vice-president, stating that Trans Union did not know if BAAF actually accessed or obtained the credit information for which it was invoiced.   Extensive discovery by Plaintiffs failed to yield any information as to who actually used the Code to obtain the credit reports or how the reports were obtained.
The district court granted BAAF summary judgment and Plaintiffs now appeal.2  We review the district court's award of summary judgment de novo, recognizing that a court should grant summary judgment only if, taking the facts in the best light for the nonmoving party, no material facts are disputed and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.   See, e.g., Jakubiak v. Perry, 101 F.3d 23, 26 (4th Cir.1996).
II.
The Fair Credit Reporting Act imposes civil liability on any “person” (which includes any corporation or other entity, 15 U.S.C. § 1681a(b)) who willfully, § 1681n, or negligently, § 1681o, fails to “comply with any requirement imposed” under the Act. See 15 U.S.C. §§ 1681n, o. The Maryland Credit Reporting Agencies Act contains virtually identical provisions.   See Md.Code Ann., Com. Law §§ 14-1213(a), (b).  Because relief under the state statute precisely parallels that under FCRA, for ease of reference, we refer within only to the FCRA.
A.
Plaintiffs principally assert that BAAF is liable under § 1681n, which provides “any consumer” a cause of action against “[a]ny person who willfully fails to comply with any requirement imposed under this subchapter.”  15 U.S.C. § 1681n(a).   Plaintiffs maintain that BAAF willfully failed to comply with the FCRA “requirement” that “[a] person ․ not use or obtain a consumer report for any purpose” not authorized under the Act. 15 U.S.C. § 1681b(f).3
 To prove willfulness under the Act, Plaintiffs must “show that the defendant knowingly and intentionally committed an act in conscious disregard for the rights of the consumer.”  Dalton v. Capital Associated Indus., Inc., 257 F.3d 409, 418 (4th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).   Plaintiffs maintain that the e-mail correspondence among BAAF employees evidences such a knowing or intentional FCRA violation.   Brief of Appellants at 18.   However, examination of these e-mails reveals only that BAAF employees in May 2000 had “no idea why or who” was still using the Code (or whether it was still being used “for valid business”) and suggested deactivation of the Code immediately upon learning of a possible impermissible use.   These e-mails do not show that anyone at BAAF “knowingly and intentionally” obtained Plaintiffs' credit reports “in conscious disregard for the rights of the consumer.”  Dalton, 257 F.3d at 418.   Accordingly, as the district court held, the Plaintiffs have failed “to produce any evidence whatsoever of knowing, intentional, or willful” FCRA violations by either BAAF or any of its employees.4
B.
Alternatively, Plaintiffs contend that BAAF is liable under § 1681o for negligently failing to implement and maintain procedures to prevent violations of the Act. Section 1681o provides a cause of action to “any consumer” against “[a]ny person who is negligent in failing to comply with any requirement imposed under this subchapter.”   Thus § 1681o, like § 1681n, merely provides a consumer with a remedy for violations of a “requirement” of the FCRA;  it does not itself set forth any “requirement.”   A consumer can use the remedy provided in § 1681o only to enforce a requirement mandated elsewhere in the FCRA.
Before the district court, Plaintiffs apparently recognized the limits of § 1681o and based their § 1681o negligence claim on a requirement found in § 1681e-to
