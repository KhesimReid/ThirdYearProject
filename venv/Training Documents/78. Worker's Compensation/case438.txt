 The sole question of law presented by this petition for a writ of review is whether Labor Code section 4660, as amended in 2004, requires the use of a permanent disability rating schedule effective January 1, 2005, to apply to injuries sustained before the schedule was adopted when none of the three exceptions set forth in subdivision (d) of section 4660 apply.1  In Aldi v. Carr, McClellan, Ingersoll, Thompson & Horn (2006) 71 Cal.Comp.Cases 783, 2006 WL 1698833 (Aldi ), the Workers' Compensation Appeals Board (Board) determined in an en banc decision that the Legislature intended section 4660 to apply to all pending matters regardless of the date of injury unless, for those claims arising before January 1, 2005, “there has been either no comprehensive medical-legal report or no report by a treating physician indicating the existence of permanent disability, or when the employer is not required to provide the notice required by Section 4061 to the injured worker.” (§ 4660, subd. (d);  Aldi, supra, 71 Cal.Comp.Cases at p. 785.)   We believe the reasoning in Aldi is sound and affirm the decision of the Board.
FACTS
The applicant, Rachel Chang, while employed as a typist by respondent State Compensation Insurance Fund, sustained an industrial cumulative trauma injury to her back and upper extremities during a period ending in July 2004.   No one disputes that the injuries became permanent and stable in 2005.   The workers' compensation judge (WCJ), applying the Board's en banc decision in Aldi, determined that none of the three exceptions to section 4660, subdivision (d) applied and therefore the permanent disability resulting from her injuries should be evaluated under the rating schedule that became effective January 1, 2005.   The schedule is based on new legislation that  requires the use of the American Medical Association Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment (5th ed.) for both the “descriptions and measurements” and the “percentages of impairments” as the basis for a disability award. (§ 4660, subd. (b)(1).)
The aggrieved applicant sought reconsideration.   She argued that the Board's en banc decision in Aldi was wrongly decided.   Bound to follow the Board's en banc decision (Cal.Code Regs., tit. 8, § 10341;  Gee v. Workers' Comp. Appeals Bd. (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 1418, 1424, fn. 6, 118 Cal.Rptr.2d 105), the WCJ recommended denial of her petition.   The Board adopted the WCJ's report and denied the petition for reconsideration.   Applicant seeks a writ of review.
DISCUSSION
 Section 4660 prescribes the method for determining the percentages of permanent disability for workers' compensation purposes.   The statute was amended on April 19, 2004, as part of Senate Bill No. 899 (2003-2004 Reg. Sess.), a package of reforms to the workers' compensation laws (Stats.2004, ch. 34).2  The legislation took effect immediately as an urgency measure.  (Stats.2004, ch. 34, § 49, p. 75.)  (McCarthy v. Workers' Comp. Appeals Bd. (2006) 135 Cal.App.4th 1230, 1232, 37 Cal.Rptr.3d 909 (McCarthy ).)   At issue is whether the Legislature intended a new permanent disability rating schedule to apply to injuries sustained before the schedule was adopted.   We must construe the meaning of section 4660 de novo, but we will accord great weight to the Board's construction in Aldi unless it is clearly erroneous.  (McCarthy, supra, 135 Cal.App.4th at p. 1234, 37 Cal.Rptr.3d 909.)
Because legislative intent is best derived from the clear, unambiguous, and plain meaning of the statutory language, we turn first to the provisions before us.  (DuBois v. Workers' Comp. Appeals Bd. (1993) 5 Cal.4th 382, 387-388, 20 Cal.Rptr.2d 523, 853 P.2d 978.)  Section 4660, subdivision (d) provides as follows:  “The schedule shall promote consistency, uniformity, and objectivity.   The schedule and any amendment thereto or revision thereof shall apply prospectively and shall apply to and govern only those permanent disabilities that result from compensable injuries received or occurring on and after the effective date of the adoption of the schedule, amendment or revision, as the fact may be.   For compensable claims arising before January 1, 2005, the schedule as revised pursuant to changes made in  legislation enacted during the 2003-04 Regular and Extraordinary Sessions shall apply to the determination of permanent disabilities when there has been either no comprehensive medical-legal report or no report by a treating physician indicating the existence of permanent disability, or when the employer is not required to provide the notice required by Section 4061 to the injured worker.”
In Aldi, the Board recognized that the second sentence of section 4660, subdivision (d) stated the general rule that the new schedule would be applied prospectively.  (Aldi, supra, 71 Cal.Comp.Cases at p. 790.)   Prospective application of the revised schedule has been a part of section 4660 since 1951 and was consistent with the express language of former section 4660, subdivision (c).  (Stats.1951, ch. 1683, § 1, p. 3880;  Stats.1965, ch. 1513, § 91, p. 3579;  Stats.1993, ch. 121, § 53, p. 1301.) 3  The addition of the third sentence of section 4660, subdivision (d) in 2004 created the issue now before us.
The Board in Aldi explained that “the third sentence of section 4660(d) provides a clear and specific exception to the general rule of prospective application as stated in the second sentence, and mandates the application of the revised rating schedule to injuries occurring before January 1, 2005, in specified instances.   That is, the third sentence unambiguously states ‘for compensable claims arising before January 1, 2005 the schedule as revised ․ shall apply to the determination of permanent disabilities' if none of the specified exceptions have been met.”  (Aldi, supra, 71 Cal.Comp.Cases at p. 791, italics added by Aldi.) The Board concluded:  “Thus, for all pending cases involving injuries occurring prior to January 1, 2005, the revised schedule must be applied unless one of the listed exceptions has been established.   Only in those cases where it can be established that at least one of the listed exceptions exists would the prior rating schedule still apply.”   (Ibid.)
 Applicant challenges the Board's interpretation of legislative intent, arguing that it fails to harmonize all the parts of the statute and to give meaning to every word or phrase so as not to render any portion of the statutory language mere surplusage.  (Hassan v. Mercy American River Hospital (2003) 31 Cal.4th 709, 715-716, 3 Cal.Rptr.3d 623, 74 P.3d 726;  Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Workers' Comp. Appeals Bd. (1999) 19 Cal.4th 1182, 1194, 81 Cal.Rptr.2d 521, 969 P.2d 613.)   Applicant urges us to consider section 4660, subdivision (e) as well as section 4660, subdivision (d).  Subdivision (e) states:  “On or before January 1, 2005, the administrative director shall adopt regulations to implement the changes made to this section by the act that added this subdivision.”   Thus, as applicant points out, the administrative director could have adopted regulations that became effective before January 1, 2005.
Considering section 4660, subdivision (e) in conjunction with the second and third sentences of section 4660, subdivision (d), applicant contends the Legislature intended the third sentence to apply only if the administrative director adopted regulations before January 1, 2005, in which case there would have been many injuries that occurred in 2004 and that would be subject to the revised rating schedule.   In other words, if the administrative director had adopted a revised schedule after April 19, 2004, but before January 1, 2005, then the revised schedule would apply to injuries sustained during 2004.   Since the new schedule did not become effective until January 1, 2005, however, the third sentence of subdivision (d) became moot.   Applicant insists that this reading of the section harmonizes the second and third sentences without implying that the third s
