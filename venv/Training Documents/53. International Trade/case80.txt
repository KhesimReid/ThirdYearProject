Divorce rates are disturbingly high.   Sometimes, marital splits get nasty when an ex-spouse decides to dish out a little dose of discomfort to his or her former partner.   And as far as dishing out discomfort is concerned, the havoc visited on Chicago lawyer Richard Connors by his ex-wife would win a gold medal for creativity.   With substantial assistance from his ex, Connors stands convicted in federal court of (among other things) violating a law we seldom encounter, the Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA), 50 U.S.C.App. §§ 5(b)(1) and 16.   Today, we resolve Connors's appeal from that conviction.
After an 11-day jury trial, Connors was found guilty of smuggling Cuban cigars into the United States in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 545;  one count of conspiracy, 18 U.S.C. § 371;  one count of making a false statement on a passport application, 18 U.S.C. § 1542;  and violating the TWEA.1 He was sentenced to a 37-month prison term.
At the trial, the government's star witness was Special Agent John Sheridan of the U.S. Customs Service.   Sheridan spent more than 3 years investigating Connors's activities.   Only after the trial did Connors learn that Agent Sheridan had an inside source of information-Connors's ex-wife, Nicole Chakalis.   Connors now argues that Chakalis's involvement in the investigation violated the Fourth Amendment and that the prosecution's failure to disclose the details of her activities before trial deprived him of due process under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963).
Sheridan began his investigation in early 1996 after Chakalis contacted him about one of her ex-husband's upcoming trips to Cuba. (Her motives are not entirely clear-she says she was concerned because Connors was planning on taking their son with him and getting him in trouble, but there also appears to have been an element of spite involved.)   Thanks to the information Chakalis provided, Connors was stopped at the Canadian border on his way back to the United States, and a trunkload of Cuban cigars (46 boxes in 4 suitcases-evidence suggests that they could be sold for something in the area of $350 per box) was seized along with Connors's passport (for which he soon obtained a replacement-more on that later).   Over the next 3 years, Chakalis continued to provide Sheridan with information about Connors's travels, dealings, and associates-information she was able to obtain by renewing her relationship with Connors and spending weekends at his house.
Chakalis's information, and other evidence gathered in the investigation, disclosed that Connors ran a fairly lucrative Cuban cigar smuggling operation.   Traveling from places like Toronto and Cancun, he made some 31 trips to Cuba between 1996 and 1999.   And Cuban cigars have a definite cachet: 2  Despite some controversy over the degree to which Cuba (where tobacco was first encountered by European explorers) has been able to maintain the quality of its cigars under communist rule, it is undisputed that the leaves grown in the fertile soil of the Vuelta Abajo, in the western province of Pinar del Río, cultivated and prepared according to centuries-old traditions, produce an incomparably smooth, pungent, and full-bodied smoke.   See James Suckling, “On the Road to Tobacco Country:  A journey into the Vuelta Abajo, land of the world's best cigar leaves,” Cigar Aficionado magazine, May/June 2001.
Connors was unaware of his ex-wife's cooperation until after the trial when, apparently remorseful, she told him what she had done.   At a post-trial hearing, she testified that Sheridan not only asked her to cozy up to Connors but also suggested that she obtain incriminating documents from his house and place them in the trash for Sheridan to retrieve.   Connors argues that this amounted to an illegal search under the Fourth Amendment, with Chakalis, in effect, acting as Sheridan's agent.   See Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U.S. 443, 487, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 29 L.Ed.2d 564 (1971);  United States v. Shahid, 117 F.3d 322, 325 (7th Cir.1997).   But Sheridan, although acknowledging that he recovered a number of pieces of evidence from Connors's garbage, denied urging Chakalis to put the pieces there for him to find.
The district court found no Fourth-Amendment violation.   For one thing, the court was uncertain that the activities Chakalis described even amounted to an illegal search, given that Connors himself welcomed her into his home.   More important, the court didn't believe that things unfolded the way Chakalis described.   The court found particularly suspicious the documentation Chakalis produced to corroborate her story-a printout of a computerized journal recounting her dealings with Sheridan, including his suggestion that she convey documents to him through the trash.   Chakalis claimed that the print-out reflected the journal in its original form without any later editing, but the court found numerous entries that referred to events after the dates on which they were supposedly written.   Also, when testifying about the journal at the hearing, Chakalis could not recall basic facts about it, such as the name of the computer file in which it was kept.   Finding the journal an unreliable source of corroboration, the court credited Agent Sheridan's testimony that he was neither involved in nor aware of any illegal search that Chakalis may have undertaken.
 Connors renews his argument that Chakalis's participation in Sheridan's investigation violated the Fourth Amendment and that all of the evidence recovered as a result of her participation should have been suppressed.   The fact that Chakalis was spying on Connors and exploiting his misplaced trust in her does not by itself amount to a constitutional violation, even if it was at the behest of the government.   See Hoffa v. United States, 385 U.S. 293, 302, 87 S.Ct. 408, 17 L.Ed.2d 374 (1966). When a friend is false, blame the friend, not the government.   Rummaging through Connors's private files for incriminating documents, however, may be another matter, see id. at 301, 87 S.Ct. 408, but only if Sheridan directed or acquiesced in it, see Shahid, 117 F.3d at 325.   The district court concluded that Sheridan did not know of any illegal rummaging and that Chakalis's contrary testimony was not credible;  the question for us is whether that was a reasonable conclusion.   Connors argues that it wasn't.   He suggests that Sheridan must have realized Connors was too cautious to throw away incriminating documents and therefore must have known the items he found in the trash were put there by Chakalis.   Maybe Sheridan could have drawn that inference, but criminal investigators are not required to assume that their targets always act prudently.   The only evidence that Sheridan knew of Connors's cautiousness comes from Chakalis's journal, in which she reports telling Sheridan that Connors “never throws anything out.”   But the district court found, as we said, the contents of that journal to be unreliable, and Connors has given us no reason to reject that finding.
 Connors also argues that the government violated his right to due process by withholding any inkling about Chakalis's involvement in the investigation.   In general, however, the government is not required to reveal the identity of nontestifying confidential informants unless the information is relevant and helpful to the defense.   See Roviaro v. United States, 353 U.S. 53, 59-62, 77 S.Ct. 623, 1 L.Ed.2d 639 (1957);  United States v. Banks, 405 F.3d 559, 564 (7th Cir.2005).   Connors doesn't argue that knowing the informant's identity would have helped his defense, but rather that there was other material in Sheridan's confidential informant file that would have allowed him to impeach Sheridan's trial testimony.   Specifically, the file shows that Chakalis at one point told Sheridan that Connors was able to devote himself to his cigar-related activities because of a large settlement he had won several years earlier in a personal-injury lawsuit, thus freeing him from th
